  "Description": "Hindu scriptures offer different teachings to meet the individual needs of different people - according to the crucial principle of adhikari-bheda (individualism). Q&A with Swamiji #8. \n\nThe teachings of the rishis, the sages of ancient India, are found in the Vedas. The Vedas are a compilation of their teachings, teaching meant for different groups of people. Thus the Vedas include the karma kanda, the section that teaches prayer and rituals for those who want contentment in this life and heaven (swarga) in the next live, and it also includes the jnana kanda, the section on pure spiritual teachings, for those who recognize the limitations of worldly life (samsara) and seek moksha, liberation or enlightenment, instead.\n\nSwami Tadatmananda is a traditionally-trained teacher of Advaita Vedanta, meditation, and Sanskrit.
