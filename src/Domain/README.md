# Domain

This project contains the domain model for the Videomatic application.

The domain model was built following these guidelines:
1. https://andrewlock.net/strongly-typed-ids-in-ef-core-using-strongly-typed-entity-ids-to-avoid-primitive-obsession-part-4/
1. https://code-maze.com/csharp-design-pattern-aggregate/

1. https://github.com/ardalis/CleanArchitecture

## Status
-Complete-ish (as much as it can be at this point) but I don't have domain events yet
-I could use a second pair of eyes on the code
-Look for Items in TODO.txt
