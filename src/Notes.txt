		Very good explanation of how to design classes following DDD conventions. See init properties all over the place.
		"I don't need navigation properties (although they're nice) because I am practicing DDD and I want Parent and Child 
		to be two separate aggregate roots. I want them to be able to talk to each other via foreign key not through 
		infrastructure-specific Entity Framework navigation properties.
		All you have to do is to configure the relationship on one side using HasOne and WithMany without specifying the 
		navigation properties (they're not there after all)."
