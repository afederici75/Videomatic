# VideomaticRadzen

A Blazor Server application that uses [Radzen](https://www.radzen.com/blazor-studio/documentation/) components.

I initially picked [Blazor Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-7.0#blazor-server) because it's the quickest way to get this working. 
It does not require a full WebAPI backend module to be ready but still uses the same 
type of requests and responses.

In the future we could have a WASM, React or Angular front-end but that would 
require the WebAPI project to be completed first.
