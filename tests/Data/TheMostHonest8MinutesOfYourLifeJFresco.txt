most people are not really hurt
by the world they're hurt by their
own expectations but what hurt him
was not the world it was his
expectations
he expected people to lean more towards
science
and less taught metaphysics and he
suspected that the system would be
would gather intelligence and know the
right direction
so what really hurt him was his own
expectations
the real answer to that question is
whatever happens in the world is real
what you think should happen is not
real so you're not disappointed by the
world
you're disappointed by your own
projections way to look at a person is i
don't know
enough about them to make a judgment
and in time when you make a judgment
you say up to now they appear to be
so-so
but something may come back that reminds
them of something else
so they hurt you they really don't hurt
you
they're normal that is normal to their
values
like my mother would believe in religion
because
it's normal to her background and when
things get tough
she prays rather than because she
doesn't know what else to do
what you have to do is take time out and
try to inform people
as to how to look at things it may take
you two or three years
to do that but we would expect to find
people
that understand what we say when they
shake their head
i guess that doesn't mean they
understand
it means they understand a limited
amount
so the point is what are your
expectations
so if a person wants to be more
analytical
they have to learn how to say i don't
know
or up to now everything seems to be
okay my relationship seems to work out
in many different areas or more areas
than i
expected sometimes we're pleasantly
surprised
by the reaction of people we had a
negative view of
i may have a negative view of you
but in time observing what you do
my negative view becomes a positive view
but if i have a negative u
it means i was projecting i really don't
know
so the point is when events occur
that are tough if a person deserts you
at that time
you understand that they can't live
under those conditions
so remember it's your own expectations
that hurt you
not the world you live in whatever
happens in the world
is real what you think should happen
is unreal so people are hurt by their
expectations any questions about that
if you have reasonable expectations such
as i don't know
then whatever happens you say gee i
didn't think it were to be that bad
how do you know how bad it would be so
what does man really want
he really wants accurate predictability
you cannot achieve that unless you're
technical
accurate predictability if an engine
fails it means
there's something wrong with a fuel pump
or any number of things
if you can't attend to those things then
the probability is
that at some time or other the engine
will fail
now i don't expect you to walk around
accepting everything that happens
i expect you to be angered and say what
can i do about it
i don't know but i want to try i'm going
to try to make it possible
for people not to be injured i'm going
to try to design a conveyor
that's on the tracks and under the
tracks that's a lot
so even in an amusement park the loop
the loop
can't go off the tracks because it's got
under braces but the other braces may be
perfect
but the structure of the unit may not be
so to the ability of an individual
to handle all those things is very
difficult
but he only knows or she only knows what
to handle
after the event do you think you know
the event has to occur first and the
person makes a safety device
and he solved that problem but there may
be other problems
and another event may occur that's
negative
and the person says what can i do about
it i don't know enough about it
i'm going to read up on it and try to
become familiar with the nature of the
problem
and try to solve it and when a person
says to you have you solved it this is
the device i made in an attempt to solve
it
will it work well according to the test
i did
it will but in reality
it was cold and the oil didn't flow so
the thing wasn't lubricated
and it didn't work there are other
factors you learn about
later on that's called after the facts
so some people get mad at technicians
they say
you're a technician why did that thing
fail what do you suggest
is what you put to that person if they
say
you designed that unit and it failed yes
it did fail
apparently i didn't know enough about
solving that problem
what do you suggest don't get bad at me
what do you suggest
you've done nothing but expect me to
solve the problem
our major concern is not profit it's the
well-being
of human beings throughout the world
to the degree that we neglect people
we hurt our own future for example
if we on the united states controlled
most of the earth's resources
we would produce anxiety in other
countries
for fear of running out of resources
arable land
water etc and therefore they might
invade this country to try to get the
necessary
resources for survival i don't think
it's wise for a nation
to defend itself or try to make
sustainability
available only in the area that they
live
because they would produce hatred and
envy
and try to control the resources of
other countries
so that we can enslave people or put
them on minimum wage
and get whatever we want produced for
the self-centered reason
of our nation and and we seek
national advantage rather than global
advantage
as long as we seek national advantage
it may work for a while it may enhance
the lifestyles
or increase the productivity of goods
and services
but that's not a long duration this is
the only thing i worry about
sustainability for separate nations
is okay in the short run but in the long
run it produces negative retroaction
