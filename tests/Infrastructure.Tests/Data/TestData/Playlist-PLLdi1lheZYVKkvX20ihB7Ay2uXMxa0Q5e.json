    "Name": "What do Buddhists believe happens after death?",
    "Description": "\u0022Simply the mind continues, because as we\u0027ve discussed in previous times, the mind is a stream of awareness which is not generated from physical causes. And so although the, as it were, the hotel of the body collapses at the moment of death, collapses as a suitable kind of receptacle for the stream of consciousness, the stream of consciousness travels on.\u0022\n\nLama Jampa Thaye is an extraordinary Buddhist master. He met his first spiritual teacher, Karma Thinley Rinpoche, at the age of 20 in 1973 and his other principal masters include H.H. Sakya Trizin and H.H. Karmapa (both the 16th and the 17th). As a result students of Lama Jampa Thaye are in the rare position to be able to receive teachings from both the Sakya and Karma Kagyu traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, which Lama Jampa delivers with exceptional clarity, down to earth humour, and compassion. For information of where and when Lama Jampa is next teaching see www.lamajampa.org",

    "Name": "Ajivika, Buddhism and Jainism: Why the 3rd Shramana religion \u0022Ajivika\u0022 was lost after 2000 years",
    "Description": "When Buddhism and Jainism were taking roots in India, they were just two of more than 62 religious groups that originated in India during the sixth century BC. Of these 62 religions only Buddhism and Jainism survived to the modern ages and the rest perished with time leaving hardly any trace behind. But one of those schools managed to survive for the next two thousand years, only to vanish forever during the late medieval times.  This was the third-largest religious group having its origins in the Shramana tradition and was followed by a large population for the next several centuries. This was the Ajivika sect. But this religion was lost in India after remaining the third largest Shramana religion in India for more than 2000 years. \nThe founder of this religion Makhhali Gosala was one of the most radical and colourful religious figures and he was preaching at the same time when Buddha and Mahavira were roaming around the Gangetic plains of India. \n\n#Ajivika #Religion #Goshala\n\n\nCredits:\nVideos:\n1.

But are the underlying rules of reality really so far from human intuition? Or are physicists just showing off? For better or worse, the physicists are definitely on the right track. We know this because the predictions of quantum field theory stand up to experimental test time and time again.  \n\nThe Great Courses Plus is currently available to watch through a web browser to almost anyone in the world and optimized for the US, UK, and Australian markets.

    "Description": "Subscribe to Big Think on YouTube \u25BA\u25BA https://www.youtube.com/c/bigthink\nCheck out Jamie Wheal\u0027s latest book \u0022Recapture the Rapture: Rethinking God, Sex and Death in a World That\u0027s Lost Its Mind\u0022 \u25BA\u25BA https://www.recapturetherapture.com/\n\nThe speed at which civilization is progressing has become overwhelming for modern humans and has caused what Jamie Wheal (author of Recapture the Rapture, founder of the Flow Genome Project, and host of the Collective Insights Podcast) calls a \u201Ccollapse of meaning.\u201D \n\nFor many, Meaning 1.0 (organized religion) and Meaning 2.0 (modern liberalism) no longer provide the structure and guidance that they used to. \u0022It does feel like the handrails, the things we used to look to for stability and security, have evaporated,\u0022 says Wheal. \u0022If we\u0027ve experienced a collapse of meaning, how do we go about restoring it?\u0022\n\nIn order to reach Meaning 3.0\u2014which Wheal says is a blend of traditional religion and modern liberalism without the promise of an escape\u2014we need to focus on mending trauma, reconnecting with inspiration, and connecting better with one another.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nJAMIE WHEAL:\n\nJamie Wheal is the founder of the Flow Genome Project and an expert in peak performance and leadership, specializing in neuroanthropology. He has advised the U.S. Naval War College and Special Operations Command, Red Bull athletes, and executives of companies including Google and Goldman Sachs. Wheal is the co-author of Stealing Fire: How Silicon Valley, the Navy SEALs, and Maverick Scientists Are Revolutionizing the Way We Live and Work.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nJAMIE WHEAL: It\u0027s really easy to forget, that we\u0027re just monkeys with clothes. If you took all of life on Earth and you compressed it into one 24-hour day, anatomically modern man shows up at four seconds before midnight, cave paintings at one second before midnight. We\u0027ve been playing at civilization for a fraction of a second.\n\nEverything is going into exponential change, from education to quantum computing, to cryptocurrency, to transport, to macroeconomics, to geopolitics, to climate crisis, to everything. It\u0027s breaking our brains. We\u0027re overwhelmed, we\u0027re collapsing in grief. It does feel that the handrails, the things that we used to look to for stability and security, have just evaporated. If we\u0027ve experienced a collapse in meaning how do we go about restoring it?\n\nI\u0027m Jamie Wheal, founder of the Flow Genome Project, and author of \u0022Recapture the Rapture: Rethinking God, Sex, and Death in a World That\u0027s Lost Its Mind.\u0022 The collapse in meaning, that I think you can at least argue we\u0027re in the midst of right now, is complex and multivariable. We\u0027ve had a collapse in traditional organized religion, what you could call kind of Meaning 1.0. For the first time ever, the nuns, the spiritual but not religious, like the \u0022none of the above\u0027s,\u0022 is the largest and fastest growing religious movement in North America. There are increasingly folks that feel like, \u0022Hey, those stories, those codes, those ways of being, don\u0027t match my identity. Don\u0027t match my choices. Don\u0027t match my community.\u0022 So organized religion is no longer a place to hang our hats. And at the same time, modern liberalism has also been getting a little creaky. That\u0027s Meaning 2.0. Think of the ivory tower in academia, news media, businesses, and corporate titans and leadership, potentially even medicine. And you just take those and you just go one by one. You\u0027re like, oh, well, Goldman Sachs sold middle America down the river in 2008. And McKinsey helped Purdue Pharma sell more OxyContin well after the negative effects were demonstrated. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, which used to be considered the journals of record are now imploding. And the same thing with doctors, the same thing with corruptions in peer review, and the replication crisis. Basically everything you\u0027ve ever seen on a TED Talk is probably not true.\n\nSo all of the places that we used to use rules of thumb or decision-making shortcuts, that\u0027s just evaporated. So in that collapse, we\u0027re getting fundamentalism on one side, and we\u0027re getting nihilism on the other. We\u0027re getting diseases of despair. We\u0027re getting real heartbreak. I think you could make a case that that is why we\u0027re seeing this uptick in conspiracy theories of all stripes. Will anybody make sense of all of this nonsense for me? If you can give me a happily ever after, if you can tell me that I\u0027m one of the good guys, and you promised to get me to the other side...\n\nTo read the full transcript, please visit https://bigthink.com/series/the-big-think-interview/collapse-of-meaning/",

    "Name": "An Intimate Encounter with Your EGO: Ahankara in Advaita Vedanta",
    "Description": "Inside your mind dwells a thought unlike any other, a thought that represents you.  It\u0027s called ego, or I-thought, or ahankara.  Discerning the nature of ego and differentiating it from the consciousness that is your true nature is a crucial step in gaining spiritual wisdom.\n\nAhankara is the sense of individuality that is present in the waking state (jagrat) and dream state (svapna) but absent in deep sleep (sushupti) and samadhi. It is the ahankara that engages in action, not pure consciousness (chit, chaityanya) which is the unchanging observer or witness (sakshi) of all mental activities (vrittis) including the ahankara.\n\nSwami Tadatmananda is a traditionally-trained teacher of Advaita Vedanta, meditation, and Sanskrit.

    "Description": "Hindu philosophy concludes on the idea of oneness. There is no separation in anything in the universe. Every atom, star and galaxy is part of the same universal soul and consciousness - which the Hindus call Brahma. We explore the 4 main concepts in Hindu philosophy: Maya, Karma, The Soul and Brahma (as best we can in 5 minutes). \n\nWe should note that there is no such thing as \u0027Hindu\u0027 philosophy as \u0027Hinduism\u0027 is not necessarily one particular sect or religion. However, for the purposes of this video, \u0027Hindu Philosophy\u0027 represents the general ideas of the Vedas and Upanishads. \n\nThis video is inspired by the lecture on Vedantism by Swami Vivekanand which can be found here: http://www.vivekananda.net/Lectures/LecturesColomboAlmora/2.html\n\nMusic:\nNight by ikson\nhttps://www.soundcloud.com/ikson \nMusic provided by https://www.plugnplaymusic.net",

    "Description": "How ecstatic, transcendent experiences arise in pure consciousness can be discovered by meditating on the sacred syllable OM as taught by the ancient rishi who composed the Mandukya Upanishad.\n\nAccording to the non-dual teachings of advaita Vedanta, the syllable om is grammatically divided into a, u, and m, the letter a representing the waking state, jagrat avastha, u representing the dream state, svapna avastha, and m representing the deep sleep state, sushupti avastha. The gap of silence between repetitions of om represent chit, consciousness, the true self, atma, with remains present as the sakshi, awareful witness to the three states. Like water fundamentally unaffected by ripples and waves, atma is fundamentally unaffected by vrittis, mental activities which are like vibrations in consciousness. \n\n\nSwami Tadatmananda\u0027s lectures on the Mandukya Upanishad are available here: https://arshabodha.org/teachings/mandukya-upanishad/ \nHis guided meditations are available here: https://arshabodha.org/teachings/meditations/\nSwami Tadatmananda is a traditionally-trained teacher of Advaita Vedanta, meditation, and Sanskrit.

    "Description": "Any time you devote to spiritual practice is stolen from worldly activities, and vice versa. This conflict is resolved through karma yoga. Life itself becomes your spiritual practice.\n\nThe teachings of karma yoga, the spiritual practice of worldly activities, is a main topic taught by Sri Krishna, an avatara or incarnation of Lord Vishnu, in the famous Bhagavad Gita. According to the non-dual spiritual teachings of Advaita Vedanta, karma yoga is necessary to become prepared for enlightenment, moksha. Without becoming an adhikari, prepared student, it is not possible to gain atma jnana, self-knowledge, discovery of your true nature (atma) as sat chit ananda, limitless, uncreated conscious existence, the so-called inner divinity that is the actual source of happiness and contentment. Karma Yoga includes a number of attitudes that transform ordinary activities into spiritual practice. Those attitudes include being a mumukshu, a seeker of enlightenment, understanding the law of karma, understanding Ishwara, God, as the karma phala data, the giver of the results of your deeds, and cultivating a prayerful sense of gratitude. \n\nSwami Tadatmananda is a traditionally-trained teacher of Advaita Vedanta, meditation, and Sanskrit.

The cities are where there\u0027s decadence, where the elites congregate, where there\u0027s immigrants, and where there\u0027s criminality. \n\nEach of these individuals alone is not in and of itself fascist, but you have to worry when they\u0027re all grouped together, seeing the other as less than. Those moments are the times when societies need to worry about fascism.\n\nRead the video transcript: https://bigthink.com/videos/what-is-fascism/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Jason Stanley:\nJason Stanley is the Jacob Urowsky Professor of Philosophy at Yale University.

    "Description": "How can we determine the validity of scientific knowledge, religious doctrines, and spiritual teachings? How can we reconcile their differences? Q\u0026A with Swamiji #6.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta is a pramana, a means of knowledge, meant to remove ignorance of your true nature (atma) being sat chit ananda, limitless, uncreated conscious existence, more simply understood as the inner divinity that\u0027s the actual source of contentment and happiness within you. Logical proofs apply to scientific, religious and scientific doctrines, but as a pramana, Vedanta does not seek to establish a doctrine, but instead, it merely removes ignorance, ignorance of your true nature that is the root cause for suffering. The proof that Vedanta works is your own experience, experience of the absence of suffering.\n\nSwami Tadatmananda is a traditionally-trained teacher of Advaita Vedanta, meditation, and Sanskrit.

    "Name": "Great Anarchists - Lucy Parsons",
    "Description": "By Ruth Kinna and Clifford Harper.\nRead by Barbara Graham and Jim Donaghey.\n\nBorn to an enslaved woman in 1851, Parsons explored class conflict through the prism of the American Civil War. A keen advocate of independent labour organising in the late nineteenth century, Parsons was active in the Knights of Labor and the anarchist International Working People\u2019s Association. In 1905 she joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). She wrote regularly for the anarchist-socialist press and lectured across America, refusing to be cowed by police bans or arrests for riot that followed as a consequence of her defiance. Parsons spearheaded the defence campaigns for the accused of the Haymarket Square bombing, and frequently referred to the injustice of the trial to spotlight the steeliness of capitalist \u2018slavocracy\u2019. \n\nPodcast also available here:\nSpotify - https://open.spotify.com/episode/0PLymZOwy7gCIQA1nDoYdq\nSticher - https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/great-anarchists/e/77619486\n\nApple - https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/great-anarchists-lucy-parsons/id1539173950?i=1000497469045\nBandcamp (free download) - https://greatanarchists.bandcamp.com/track/great-anarchists-lucy-parsons\n\n\nThe Great Anarchists pamphlet series is published by Dog Section Press and Active Distribution.

    "Name": "Great Anarchists - Errico Malatesta",
    "Description": "By Ruth Kinna and Clifford Harper.\nRead by Barbara Graham and Jim Donaghey.\n\nMalatesta is the living link between the demise of the First International in 1871 and the start of the struggle against European fascism some forty years later. As an anarchist-communist and organisationalist, Malatesta rejected individualism as gestural politics, and while he advocated workers\u2019 self-organisation, he was cautious about syndicalism. But he was pragmatic rather than doctrinaire, and stood in solidarity with his opponents within the anarchist movement. Spending long stretches of time in exile, dodging arrest and escaping jail, he travelled widely in Europe, as well as Egypt, the US and Cuba, with periods of settlement in Italy, Argentina and the UK. Wherever he happened to be, he always played a prominent role in Italian anarchist politics, editing a series of highly influential newspapers and writing numerous popular pamphlets. His stature in the anarchist movement was demonstrated during the campaign to stop his threatened deportation from the UK, which drew a crowd of 15,000 to a meeting in Trafalgar Square in June 1912.\n\nPodcast also available here:\nSpotify - https://open.spotify.com/episode/4brNJO78itOmtAWLEvUEk7\nSticher - www.stitcher.com/podcast/great-anarchists\nApple - https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/great-anarchists-errico-malatesta/id1539173950?i=1000497469041\nBandcamp - https://greatanarchists.bandcamp.com/track/great-anarchists-errico-malatesta\n\n\nThe Great Anarchists pamphlet series is published by Dog Section Press and Active Distribution.

    "Name": "All I\u2019m Offering is the Truth | The Philosophy of the Matrix",
    "Description": "The Matrix, a science fiction film created by the Wachowskis, is probably one of the most influential movies ever made. The story starts when computer programmer Thomas Anderson, operating as a hacker under the alias \u201CNeo,\u201D discovers the truth about the world he\u2019s living in, as he becomes aware of the existence of something known as \u201CThe Matrix.\u201D\n\nThe Matrix is considered a philosophical film that contains many existing philosophical and religious themes, like prophecy, love, truth, karma, the nature of reality, and living in a simulation.  But there seems to be a particularly close connection between The Matrix and Plato\u2019s Allegory of the Cave.\n\nThis video (All I\u2019m Offering Is The Truth | The Philosophy of the Matrix) is a philosophical analysis of the Matrix film. It analyses The Matrix through the lens of Plato\u2019s Allegory of the Cave while exploring the following question: do we, as human beings, actually want the truth?\n\nPlease note: this video contains spoilers that reveal the plot.\n\nSupport the channel:\n\u2714\uFE0F PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n\u2714\uFE0F Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n\u2714\uFE0F Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

    "Name": "10 Life Lessons From Friedrich Nietzsche (Existentialism)",
    "Description": "In this video we will be talking about 10 Life Lessons From Friedrich Nietzsche. Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s work is revolutionary, aiming for a \u201Cre-evaluation of all values\u201D. He was one of the biggest precursors of existentialism.\n\nSo with that in mind, here are 10 important lessons that we can learn from Friedrich Nietzsche - \n01. Be a harmonious totality\n02. Avoid having a reactive life\n03. Avoid holding resentment towards others\n04. Don\u2019t blindly follow the Masters\n05. Find your Why\n06. Suffering can make you stronger\n07. Avoid being just \u201Cbusy\u201D\n08. Live dangerously\n09. Become a Superhuman\n10. Happiness is the way you approach your goals\n\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 10 life lessons from Friedrich Nietzsche will add value to your life. \n\nFriedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher, poet, essayist, and cultural critic. He is considered to be one of the most daring and greatest thinkers of all time. His writings on truth, morality, language, aesthetics, cultural theory, history, nihilism, power, consciousness, and the meaning of existence have exerted an enormous influence on Western philosophy and intellectual history. He was one of the biggest precursors of existentialism, which emphasizes the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent, determining their own development through acts of will. By his famous words \u201CGod is dead!\u201D, Nietzsche moved the focus of philosophy from metaphysics to the material world and to the individual as a responsible person for his own life. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote several books like The Birth of a Tragedy,  Human, All Too Human, The Dawn, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols, The Will to Power, The Antichrist, and many more. His teachings have shaped the lives of many people; from psychologists to poets, dancers to social revolutionaries.\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ",

    "Name": "Why The World Is Always In Conflict (Documentary)",
    "Description": "There is so much hatred in the world. Many people banding together based on group identification. As a result, our perception of the world is clouded, and we\u0027re unable to see the world as it truly is. Division and conflict are the result when we are literally blind to the truth. The fabric of society is built on the foundation that separation is true. But is separation really true? Or is separation the heart of a tired old game that is the root cause of all the problems in the world? If our mentality of separation is true, then why does it only cause conflict? In this documentary, I will tackle these questions head on. I will address the adult conversation we try to avoid having.\n\nSUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/OneWorldWithin for new videos every week\n\nSUPPORT MY WORK \nPatreon https://www.patreon.com/jasongregory \nPaypal https://www.paypal.me/JasonGregoryAuthor\n\nMY BOOKS\nEmotional Intuition for Peak Performance https://amzn.to/2oZZdFm\nEffortless Living http://amzn.to/2z0EG3Q\nFasting the Mind http://amzn.to/2zhsAY1\nEnlightenment Now http://amzn.to/2B2oNuV\nThe Science and Practice of Humility http://amzn.to/2z01WPb\n\nMERCHANDISE\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/jason-gregory\n\nMY CAMERA GEAR\nMain Camera https://amzn.to/2DXxuvv\nMain Lens https://amzn.to/2Shk5BF\nMicrophone https://amzn.to/2S6Evgm\nTripod https://amzn.to/2SdLxA8\n\nFOLLOW ME\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/jasongregoryauthor/\nTwitter https://twitter.com/JasonGregory33\nFacebook Personal Page https://www.facebook.com/jason.gregory.oneworldwithin\nFacebook Like Page https://www.facebook.com/JasonGregoryAuthor/\nLinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasongregoryauthor/\nAmazon Author Page https://www.amazon.com/Jason-Gregory/e/B0053O1HKK/\nGoodreads Author Page https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3021190.Jason_Gregory\n\nTHE JASON GREGORY PODCAST AUDIO\nSpotify https://open.spotify.com/show/5M7o63rxZ1Co5x86zktVYD\nApple Podcasts https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/enlightenment-today-with-jason-gregory/id1304105394 \nGoogle Podcasts https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9qYXNvbmdyZWdvcnkub3JnL2ZlZWQvcG9kY2FzdC8  \nAnchor https://anchor.fm/jasongregory\n\nMY WEBSITE https://jasongregory.org/\n\nDisclaimer: Jason Gregory is an Amazon Associate member.

    "Description": "Liberal vs. Conservative: A Neuroscientific Analysis with Gail Saltz\nNew videos DAILY: https://bigth.ink\nJoin Big Think Edge for exclusive video lessons from top thinkers and doers: https://bigth.ink/Edge\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat the difference in brain structure between liberals and conservatives? And where do our political convictions come from: rational deliberation, or biological determinism?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGAIL SALTZ:\n\nDr. Gail Saltz is a bestselling author of numerous books and the go-to expert on a variety of important psychological issues. She is Chair of the 92nd Street Y \u00227 Days of Genius Advisory Committee\u0022 and Consultant and Event Moderator for the Clinton Foundation\u0027s Health Matters Initiative. Dr. Saltz is an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the NY Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of medicine, a psychoanalyst with the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, and has a private practice in Manhattan. \u00A0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nGail Saltz: So I think what\u2019s really fascinating is that there have been a number of recent studies looking at brain structural differences between liberals and conservatives. And what\u2019s been found in several studies is that liberals tend to have a larger anterior cingulate gyrus. That is an area that is responsible for taking in new information and that impact of the new information on decision making or choices. Conservatives tended on the whole to have a larger right amygdala. Amygdala being a deeper brain structure that processes more emotional information - specifically fear based information. So it\u2019s really responsible for the flight or fright response. And this isn\u2019t everybody. It\u2019s not black and white and of course then, you know, what about all of the people in the middle? But basically the study showed that if you just based it on brain structural size different you could predict who would be a conservative and who would be a liberal with frequency of 71.6 percent.\n\n71.6 percent is a pretty high ability to predict who is a conservative and who is a liberal just from brain structure. When you look at what your parents were in terms of predicting what you might be in terms of conservative versus liberal, that enabled you to predict in studies at a rate of 69.5 percent. So very close. Not quite as good and why is that interesting? It\u2019s because the brain is plastic. So the question as to whether you have a brain structure to start with that informs whether you will be a liberal or conservative or whether the formation of certain thoughts from your parents for example shapes your brain structure. Because the brain is plastic and ever changing, particularly in youth. So does thinking certain thoughts or predominantly let\u2019s say utilizing your right amygdala versus your anterior cingulate gyrus inform the growth of those areas and therefore help you predict later who is liberal and who is conservative.\n\r\nSo in terms of interpreting the meaning of different sized structures for a liberal versus a conservative I think you have to look at what that area is predominantly responsible for. So for instance for conservatives if you\u2019re right amygdala is enlarged and that\u2019s the fear processing area you would expect maybe choices or decisions or character and personality to be more informed by a response to a fearful situation. So for example conservatives in fact in personality studies do tend to rate higher in areas of stability, loyalty, not liking change, being more religiously involved in terms of decision making, having that rate higher for them in making certain choices. And if you look at liberals from a personality character standpoint you\u2019re going to find stronger ratings in terms of liking change wanting to actually base decision making on new information, on science information. And so those differences are not surprising in light of these brain structural differences.\n\r\nBeing a liberal or being a conservative really is not black and white. It\u2019s really a bell shaped curve where, you know, someone who considers themselves conservative may be far less conservative so to speak than someone else who still calls themselves a conservative. And that bell shaped curve continues all the way through where in the middle there may be a large group that calls themselves independents.\n\r\nWhat we don\u2019t know is whether that has to do with differences in brain structure and so would we see in independents, no one\u2019s does that study to say oh, independents don\u2019t show any differences in brain structure or any differences in say risk taking reaction. So we don\u2019t know for sure what that means but I think it\u2019s fair to say that even when we looked a...\n\nFor the full transcript, check out https://bigthink.com/videos/gail-saltz-the-brain-differences-of-liberals-versus-conservatives",

    "Description": "This video was made in collaboration with Academy of Ideas. They create videos explaining the ideas of history\u0027s great thinkers in order to help supply the world with more knowledge, to empower the individual, and to promote freedom. Please check out their youtube channel for more brilliant content. https://www.youtube.com/c/academyofideas or visit their website to learn more https://academyofideas.com/\n\nIn this video we are going to explore the most dangerous of all psychic epidemics, the mass psychosis. A mass psychosis is an epidemic of madness and it occurs when a large portion of a society loses touch with reality and descends into delusions. Such a phenomenon is not a thing of fiction. Two examples of mass psychoses are the American and European witch hunts 16th and 17th centuries and the rise of totalitarianism in the 20th century.\n\nThis video will aim to answer questions surrounding mass psychosis: What is it? How does is start? Has it happened before? Are we experiencing one right now? And if so, how can the stages of a mass psychosis be reversed?\n\nThis video took a tremendous amount of work. It truly is a labor of love and if you appreciate this video and want to help support the creation of more videos, please consider supporting After Skool on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\n\nGet the After Skool Kid\u0027s Book - Why Don\u0027t Country Flags Use The Color Purple? https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Country-Flags-Color-Purple/dp/0578489244\nGet in touch via https://www.afterskool.net/",

    "Name": "7 Stoic Ways to Escape the Chains of the World",
    "Description": "When we look at the human condition, we notice that most of us are entirely controlled by a world outside of us. When we get what we want from it, we\u2019re happy. But when it\u2019s taken away from us, we\u2019re sad. The praise people give us uplifts us, but their dislike makes us miserable. The more we want something, the more we\u2019re willing to sacrifice to get it. And the more we oppose something, the higher the price we\u2019re ready to pay to avoid it.\n\nThese chains of desire and aversion, love and hate, of like and dislike, leave us fearful and open to manipulation by shaming and blaming, the appeal of large companies, political parties, cults, and other external forces that want something from us. And thus, the world governs us like a donkey rider with a carrot on a stick, which most of us follow from birth to death, like the obedient cattle we are. But what if we decide to reject the carrot? What if we choose to escape the system?\n\nSupport the channel:\n\u2714\uFE0F PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n\u2714\uFE0F Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n\u2714\uFE0F Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

    "Description": "The Neuroscience of Creativity, Perception, and Confirmation Bias \nWatch the newest video from Big Think: https://bigth.ink/NewVideo\nJoin Big Think\u002B for exclusive videos: https://bigthink.com/plus/\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo ensure your survival, your brain evolved to avoid one thing: uncertainty. As neuroscientist Beau Lotto points out, if your ancestors wondered for too long whether that noise was a predator or not, you wouldn\u0027t be here right now. Our brains are geared to make fast assumptions, and questioning them in many cases quite literally equates to death. No wonder we\u0027re so hardwired for confirmation bias. No wonder we\u0027d rather stick to the status quo than risk the uncertainty of a better political model, a fairer financial system, or a healthier relationship pattern. But here\u0027s the catch: as our brains evolved toward certainty, we simultaneously evolved away from creativity\u2014that\u0027s no coincidence; creativity starts with a question, with uncertainty, not with a cut and dried answer. To be creative, we have to unlearn millions of years of evolution. Creativity asks us to do that which is hardest: to question our assumptions, to doubt what we believe to be true. That is the only way to see differently. And if you think creativity is a chaotic and wild force, think again, says Beau Lotto. It just looks that way from the outside. The brain cannot make great leaps, it can only move linearly through mental possibilities. When a creative person forges a connection between two things that are, to your mind, so far apart, that\u0027s a case of high-level logic. They have moved through steps that are invisible to you, perhaps because they are more open-minded and well-practiced in questioning their assumptions. Creativity, it seems, is another (highly sophisticated) form of logic. Beau Lotto is the author of Deviate: The Science of Seeing Differently.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nBEAU LOTTO:\n\nBeau Lotto is a professor of neuroscience, previously at University College London and now at the University of London, and a Visiting Scholar at New York University.\n\nHis work focuses on the biological, computational and psychological mechanisms of perception. He has conducted and presented research on human and bumblebee perception and behavior for more than 25 years, and his interest in education, business and the arts has led him into entrepreneurship and engaging the public with science.\n\nIn 2001, Beau founded the Lab of Misfits, a neuro-design studio that was resident for two years at London\u0027s Science Museum and most recently at Viacom in New York. The lab\u0027s experimental studio approach aims to deepen our understanding of human nature, advance personal and social well-being through research that places the public at the centre of the process of discovery, and create unique programmes of engagement that span the boundaries between people, disciplines and institutions. Originally from Seattle, with degrees from UC Berkeley and Edinburgh Medical School, he now lives in Oxford and New York.\n\nwww.labofmisfits.com\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nTRANSCRIPTION:\n\nBeau Lotto: Every behavior that we do, we do to reduce uncertainty. We do it to increase certainty. When you go down below in a boat and your eyes are moving and registering the boat, and your eyes are saying, \u201COh, we\u2019re standing still,\u201D but your inner ears are saying, \u201CNo, no, we\u2019re moving.\u201D And your brain cannot deal with that conflict so it gets ill.\n\nThe stress resulting from uncertainty is tremendous in our society. It increases brain cell death. It decreases plasticity. It makes you a more extreme version of yourself. We do almost everything to avoid uncertainty. And yet the irony is that that\u2019s the only place we can go if we\u2019re ever going to see differently. And that\u2019s why creativity, seeing differently, always begins in the same way: it begins with a question. It begins with not knowing. It begins with a \u0027why?\u0027. It begins with a \u0027what if?\u0027.\n\nAnd I should also say that these assumptions are essential for your survival. Every time you take a step your brain has hundreds of assumptions: that the floor is not going to give way, that your legs aren\u2019t going to give way, that that\u2019s not a hole, it\u2019s a surface. So these assumptions keep us alive. But they can also get in the way, because what was once useful may no longer be useful. So your brain evolved to evolve. It\u0027s adapted to adapt. So a deep question is: how is it possible to ever see differently if everything you see is a reflex grounded in your history of assumptions?\n\nRead the full transcript at https://bigthink.com/videos/beau-lotto-creativity-is-another-form-of-logic",

    "Name": "Why Letting Go Is True Wealth | Minimalist Philosophy for Simple Living",
    "Description": "Humans often overburden themselves with all kinds of material possessions, buying much more than we need to stay alive and thriving. Consumerism comes with a price as well, as it requires resources to keep up with the other consumers.\n\nTherefore, many people are willing to work themselves into an early grave, and simply accumulate, what we could call, \u2018extensions of themselves\u2019; extensions of their egos. \u201CI have more, so I am more,\u201D they tend to think, so by increasing their possessions they increase their sense of self.\n\nBut there\u2019s a counter-movement to the consumerist society we\u2019re living in, known as minimalism. Minimalists are people who turn their backs to overconsumption and decide to live with no more than necessary.\n\nAside from it being a lifestyle trend today, minimalism is a concept that people have been practicing for centuries. There\u2019s a sense of freedom in simplicity, and not owning much, which many sages and philosophers have experienced throughout the ages. They saw that possessions don\u2019t define who we are and that the ongoing pursuit of external things prevents us from experiencing life to the fullest.\n\nThis video examines the philosophical side of minimalism and explores why more is less and why less is more, and why letting go is true wealth (minimalist philosophy for simple living).\n\nSupport the channel:\n\u2714\uFE0F PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n\u2714\uFE0F Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n\u2714\uFE0F Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

    "Name": "Finding Something to Live and Die For | The Philosophy of Viktor Frankl",
    "Description": "What keeps a human being going? The purest answer to this question is perhaps to be found in the worst of places. Austrian psychiatrist, philosopher, and author Viktor Frankl spent three years in four different concentration camps. He was at the mercy of sadistic SS guards and the so-called \u201CCapos:\u201D prisoners with special privileges who willingly collaborated with the Nazis and were even more ruthless than their masters. \n\nThe camp inmates were constantly exposed to famine, sickness, slave labor, and the possibility of punishment or execution. There was no freedom. The prisoners moved around like a defenseless flock of sheep, kicked and beaten by their shepherds, stripped of all human dignity.\n\nWhat\u2019s left to live for in such a horrible place like a concentration camp? When they\u2019ve taken all your liberties and possessions, and when death at short notice is almost inevitable, is there any reason not to give up on life? Viktor Frankl concluded that there\u2019s always a reason to live even in the worst conditions: there\u2019s always meaning in suffering. And if we can grasp this meaning - this star in the sky - we can overcome even the most painful circumstances. \n\nAccording to Viktor Frankl, it\u2019s not pleasure nor success and power that essentially drives people; it\u2019s finding something - a purpose, a meaning - to live and even die for (Finding Something to Live and Die For | The Philosophy of Viktor Frankl).\n\nThe quotes in this video are from Viktor Frankl\u0027s book \u0027Man\u0027s Search for Meaning\u0027.\n\nSupport the channel:\n\u2714\uFE0F PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n\u2714\uFE0F Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n\u2714\uFE0F Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

    "Description": "The HIDDEN Danger of Productivity | A Monk\u0027s Warning\n\nBefore you get on the productivity bandwagon, it\u0027s important to know where you are going. The hustle culture teaches us how to hack productivity. We are encouraged to 2x, 3x, even 10x our productivity. We need to eat, sleep, breathe and grind productivity. Let\u0027s squeeze all we can in a given 24 hour period. If you\u0027re not productive, that means you didn\u0027t make the best use of your day. \u0022Go hard or go home!\u0022 .... \n\nPhew! \n\nOKAY, that was exhausting! Now let\u0027s come back to reality :) While working hard is a great quality, there is one thing that we are missing in this conversation. In this video, I point out the one thing we MUST do first before we 10x our productivity.

    "Description": "The Way You Make Your Bed \u0026 What It Reveals About You | A Monk\u0027s Perspective\n\nMaking your bed is important. As a Buddhist monk, one of the first things we are trained in is the importance of making our beds. The way one makes their bed will impact their habits. Our time in the bedroom makes ups 30% of our daily lives, so what we do in the bedroom will directly impact our behaviors outside of the bedroom. In this video, I give you 3 scenarios of how one makes their bed and how it translate to the type of habit the will cultivate. I hope this perspective from the buddhist monk lens will give you a different perspective into the importance of making your bed. I hope this helps.

    "Name": "Taoism vs Christianity - Why Religious Conversion is Against Nature",
    "Description": "In this podcast, we will explain the differences between the Taoist path of non-interference and the path of interference through religious conversion within Christianity. The path of conversion is a doctrinal privilege within some religions based on demographic swamping, which is diametrically opposed to the non-expansionist views of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. This doctrinal privilege has caused a lot of bloodshed for thousands of years and, as a result, continually undermines and belittles other cultures and spiritual traditions. While, on the other hand, the Eastern traditions have followed the path of non-force and don\u0027t have any doctrinal privilege based on demographic swamping. The Eastern traditions are based on nature, peace, and ultimate liberation from the illusion of a separate self, which requires us to understand that the way of the Tao (or in finding God for a Christian) is discovered in following the path of least resistance and not forcing a cultural viewpoint upon others. But the problem we have continually encountered in the world is when will such outdated views of conversion actually listen to other cultures and spiritual traditions, without projecting their own dogmatic beliefs upon them based on their outdated doctrinal privilege. Can we listen to each other without the veils of conditioning to allow the world to be as it should be, without any interference?                 \n\nSUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/OneWorldWithin for new videos every week\n\nSUPPORT MY WORK \nPatreon https://www.patreon.com/jasongregory \nPaypal https://www.paypal.me/JasonGregoryAuthor\n\nMY BOOKS\nEmotional Intuition for Peak Performance https://amzn.to/2oZZdFm\nEffortless Living http://amzn.to/2z0EG3Q\nFasting the Mind http://amzn.to/2zhsAY1\nEnlightenment Now http://amzn.to/2B2oNuV\nThe Science and Practice of Humility http://amzn.to/2z01WPb\n\nPRIVATE CONSULTATION\nhttps://jasongregory.org/contact/\n\nMERCHANDISE\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/jason-gregory\n\nMY CAMERA GEAR\nMain Camera https://amzn.to/2DXxuvv\nMain Lens https://amzn.to/2Shk5BF\nMicrophone https://amzn.to/2S6Evgm\nTripod https://amzn.to/2SdLxA8\n\nFOLLOW ME\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/jasongregoryauthor/\nTwitter https://twitter.com/JasonGregory33\nFacebook Personal Page https://www.facebook.com/jason.gregory.oneworldwithin\nFacebook Like Page https://www.facebook.com/JasonGregoryAuthor/\nLinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasongregoryauthor/\nAmazon Author Page https://www.amazon.com/Jason-Gregory/e/B0053O1HKK/\nGoodreads Author Page https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3021190.Jason_Gregory\n\nTHE JASON GREGORY PODCAST AUDIO\nSpotify https://open.spotify.com/show/5M7o63rxZ1Co5x86zktVYD\nApple Podcasts https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/enlightenment-today-with-jason-gregory/id1304105394 \nGoogle Podcasts https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9qYXNvbmdyZWdvcnkub3JnL2ZlZWQvcG9kY2FzdC8  \nAnchor https://anchor.fm/jasongregory\n\nMY WEBSITE https://jasongregory.org/\n\nDisclaimer: Jason Gregory is an Amazon Associate member.

The word \u201CZen\u201D reflects this: it is the Japanese way of pronouncing the Chinese character \u201CChan,\u201D which, itself, derives from the Indian Buddhist term \u201Cjhana.\u201D \u201CJhana\u201D means \u201Cmeditation,\u201D so Chan Buddhism or Zen Buddhism literally means a particular type of Buddhism that emphasizes meditation.\n\n-----\n\n~Written: David Loy\n\n~Narration: Luke Mullins\n\n~Film: Digifish\n\n-\n\nWebsites:\n\n~David Loy: http://www.davidloy.org/\n\n~Luke Mullins: https://voice123.com/profiles/lukemullins/\n\n~Digifish: http://www.digifish.tv/",

    "Name": "5 Major Reasons Religion Is the No.1 Cause of Poverty in Africa | Rev Walter Mwambazi | TEDxLusaka",
    "Description": "One of the greatest enigmas of our time that begs an explanation is how a continent endowed with so much wealth and resources (human, food, mineral and land) can be so poor as to have 16 of the 20 poorest nations on earth. Hard discussions on this perennial African development question are ignited by Rev Walter in this talk, where he suggests that religion and its cascading effects is the biggest obstacle to development. He also proposes a solution to how Africans can free themselves from religious slavery! Reverend Walter Mwambazi is chiefly a thought transformation leader, but he is also a networker, digital \u0026 traditional marketer, published author, newspaper columnist, blogger, neural-linguistic and cognitive enhancement coach, radio \u0026 television personality and a social influencer. Before all this, he was an ordained and in-service minister for 5 years. Reverend Walter is married with 3 children. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

Why don\u0027t we see consciousness in the material world? What do we mean by \u0022I\u0022? Why is any of this important?\n\nFrom the deep pools of Eastern wisdom, to the fast-paced rapids of the West, Peter Russell has mastered many fields, and synthesized them with consummate artistry. Weaving his unique blend of scientific rationale, global vision, and intuitive wisdom, Peter brings a sharp, critical mind to the challenge of self-awakening. The next great frontier of human exploration, he shows, is not outer space, but inner space \u2014 the development of the human mind. He has degrees in theoretical physics, experimental psychology, and computer science from the University of Cambridge in England, and has written ten books in this area, including The Global Brain Awakens, Waking Up in Time, and most recently, From Science to God: A Physicist\u2019s Journey into the Mystery of Consciousness.",

    "Name": "Why I quit the corporate world to start teaching mud house construction",
    "Description": "Shagun Singh was a corporate business head. She quit her job in 2015 and moved to Nainital in Uttarakhand. She was looking for a place where she can build a home with her own hands. The idea was to create a magical place where one can grow food, where there is energy, water, and to live as holistically as possible. She found a barren piece of land in  Mahrora, a village close to Nainital. Later she started making mud houses and founded a training centre called Geeli Mitti. People from different parts of the world come and learn different mud construction techniques here. She emphasizes on the importance of mud over cement.",

In the inner realization of the Truth, you are discovering something tremendous. \n\nThe peace that I speak about is coming from the Truth within you.\u201D\n\n23 April 2020\nMonte Sahaja, Portugal\n\n-\n\nIf you would like to support the sharing of Satsang, you can donate here: https://mooji.org/donate?tcode=mtv7\n\nThis and many other videos can be viewed on Mooji.TV:\nhttp://bit.ly/moojitv and http://bit.ly/sahaja-express\n\r\n#Mooji #satsang #spirituality #advaita #nonduality #awakening",

    "Description": "Why did the Protestant Reformation Happen?\n\n\u2666 The Protestant Reformation is widely known for Martin Luther\u2019s publication of his \u201C95 Theses\u201D or \u201CDisputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences\u201D and marks the second schism of sorts for the Catholic church.  In reality, the reformation of western Christianity was long in the making, and Martin Luther was not its only leader\u2026\n While many view the start of the Protestant Reformation as having been in 1517 following the publication of Martin Luther\u2019s theses, the actual date of its beginning is somewhat unclear.  There were essentially three main reformation movements; one in Germany, one in England, and one in Switzerland - with all of them occurring around the same time in the 16th century.\n\n\n\u2666Consider to Support the Channel of Patreon and gain cool stuff: \r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Knowledgia\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2666Please consider to SUBSCRIBE : https://goo.gl/YJNqek\r\n\r\n\u2666Music Used :\r\n Kevin MacLeod - Impact Allegretto\n Kevin MacLeod - Echoes of Time\n\n\u2666Script \u0026 Research :\nSkylar Gordon \r\n\r\n\u2666Sources :\r\n\r\n history.com\n britannica.com\n khanacademy.org\n history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch\n\r\n#History #Documentary",

    "Name": "Seneca | Why Worry About What Isn\u0027t Real? (Stoicism)",
    "Description": "In a letter to his dear friend Lucilius, Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote: \u201CThere are more things, Lucilius, likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often in imagination than in reality.\u201D \n\nChronic worriers tend to be more occupied by the future than by present circumstances. During the day, and even during the night, their thoughts wander in the mysterious realm of what\u2019s yet to come, plotting, planning, and calculating on how to tackle an unfortunate fate that might rear its ugly head.\n\nBut even though they wish to control the future, they\u2019ve never gone beyond the confines of the present. This is because the future doesn\u2019t exist, except in our minds. We can\u2019t live in the future, and we can\u2019t predict it. Sure, we can plan for things that might come, but the present usually unfolds in different and often surprising ways.\n\nStill, many of us fix our attention on the unknown and fantasize endlessly about how things that we can\u2019t possibly predict will present themselves to us. Seneca observed this phenomenon in his friend Lucilius as well as in the people around him. He counterattacked this often tiresome and destructive stance towards the illusory domain of the future with Stoic reasoning, explaining why worrying about it is pointless, and advising us on what to do instead.\n\nThis video (Why Worry About What Isn\u0027t Real? | Seneca\u0027s Philosophy to End Worrying) explores Seneca\u2019s antidotes to worry and groundless fears.\n\nSupport the channel:\n\u2714\uFE0F PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n\u200B\u2714\uFE0F Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n\u2714\uFE0F Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

    "Description": "The incredible tent of the Khanty nomads made from the peeled bark of the birch tree boiled with fish!. As ecological and sustainable architecture as there is. This is green building taken to a new level, yet the tradition is hundreds, possibly thousands of years old. Natural building materials are sourced locally, it is zero carbon and perfectly adapted to the climate. There is a lot we can learn from these buildings. \n\nThe birch bark is boiled in a fish stew, with moss or lichen added, and together these combine with the heat to soften the bark and make it pliable enough to sew, and waterproof enough to last for years.\n\nWe met the last true master of the art, Rosa, who showed us the whole process, and we want to make one.

    "Description": "An ancient Christian tomb was discovered in 1945 when workers in Egypt found 13 leather-bound manuscripts, which revealed more information about the sect of Christians called \u0022Gnostics,\u0022 meaning they teach salvation through mystical knowledge.\n\nThis sect was ultimately destroyed by the Roman orthodox church. Their followers were burned at the stake and their writings were destroyed. \n\nIn the year 325 AD, we lost tremendous amounts of information. The emperor Constantine, in the early Christian church, with the early Christian Bible made decisions on what information to include, and what information to exclude.\n\nWhat we know now is that at least 45 books were either completely taken away or tremendously edited, into what we call today our western biblical tradition.\n\nWhen those edits were made we lost the information that tells us everything is connected.\n\nRead the FULL ARTICLE HERE with Translations in all Languages: https://garylite.com/2018/08/28/the-lost-forbidden-teachings-of-jesus/\n\nThe lost gospel of Thomas: http://www.marquette.edu/maqom/Gospel%20of%20Thomas%20Lambdin.pdf\n\nSource: Gregg Braden - https://www.greggbraden.com/\n\nReferences: \nThe Gospel According to Thomas, Gregg Braden, Neville Goddard\n\nRead the FULL ARTICLE HERE with Translations in all Languages:\n\n\u25C9 My Websites:  \nhttp://garylite.com/\n\nHELP SUPPORT MY WORK \uD83D\uDC97\uD83D\uDE4F\uD83D\uDC97\nIf you wish to make a small Donation click on the link below: \nThank you \n\n\u25C9 PayPal Donation Link: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick\u0026hosted_button_id=6QHHNJVALEQDN\n\n\u25C9 Visit my Gaia Portal by clicking the link in the description area below. \nYou can watch Free videos and join with a special 7-day FREE Trial.   \n\uD83D\uDC49 https://www.gaia.com/garylite \n\n\u25C9 Information on Spooky2 Resonance Frequency Generator Essential Kits can be found here at: https://www.spooky2-mall.com/ref/455/\nGet 3% off your order by entering coupon code: garylite \n\n#jesus #jesuschrist #gospelofthomas",

    "Description": "In September 2020, 4 upper caste Thakur men allegedly brutally gang-raped and attacked a 19-year-old Dalit woman in India\u2019s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh.

    "Description": "For as long as they\u2019ve existed, conspiracy theories have been laughed off by the mainstream for being too \u2018far-fetched\u2019. But actually, many of them haven\u2019t been fetched from very far away at all. \n\nIn fact, lots of the biggest ones have been lifted straight from pop culture. Bupe Bhima looks at the books, films, shows and songs that have been giving conspiracy theorists sleepless nights for decades.\n\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\r\n\r\nAbout VICE:\r\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

But as social media exploded over the past decade, he got addicted like the rest of us -- trying to gain followers and likes only to be left feeling inadequate and less creative. In a refreshingly honest talk, he explores how the attention-driven model of big tech companies impacts our creativity -- and shares a more powerful feeling than getting attention: paying attention.\n\nGet TED Talks recommended just for you!

    "Name": "HOW ARE YOU, REALLY?",
    "Description": "One of the most important aspects of being human is the fact that we have feelings - all day long.   From childhood we are taught to stop being sad or to hold in our anger.  But these emotions always find a way to leak out, sometimes in the form of self-criticism or depression.  We need to learn to acknowledge our emotions, and to be compassionate and kind to ourselves when these feelings arise.

    "Description": "Escaping the rat race isn\u2019t about quitting a 9-5 job. It\u2019s about avoiding the \u201CMoney Trap\u201D. A race to the next paycheck, or material possession. \n\nIn this video we take a look at what the rat race truly is, ways in which personal finance can help, as well as understanding the relationship between consumption and production.

It\u2019s often used to guilt those who have a disliking towards their jobs into purchasing a course, program, or something of that nature. \n\nA real rat race isn\u2019t about working a 9-5 job, it\u2019s about living on a financial edge. Such that your greater life goals and ambitions are placed in the background as you continue chasing the next paycheck, or material possession. \n\nOur relationship seems with money is often as follows: it enters our life, and it leaves. Sometimes this is expressed as your income and expenses, but I think a better way of framing this is your production vs your consumption. \n\nFor most of us, we have an issue with consumption. And when fixing this, it may be best to first draw an awareness to yourself as a consumer. Using a budget and tracking your expense is the best way of starting. A common strategy in personal finance is building an \u201Cemergency fund\u201D, a fund that holds 3 \u2013 6 months\u2019 worth of expenses \u2013 enough so that if an emergency were to ever occur, you wouldn\u2019t have a problem financially supporting yourself through such an occasion. \n\nProduction is then about increasing the amount of value you can bring to a society. In my video the Untold Truth About Money I mentioned that people are paid in proportion to their perceived value in the marketplace, and one of the best ways of increasing your perceived value is by solving a problem in the market, then selling this solution through a business at scale. This is the entrepreneurial route. And whilst most of us will be able to produce value into the market by selling our labour in the form of a 9-5 job, this doesn\u2019t mean our ability to produce stops there. \n\nYouTube channels like Graham Stephan, or Dave Ramsey are great for learning about personal finance, and reducing your expenses. But these people don\u2019t rely on cutting coupons/living frugally to be making millions. They are utilising a means of production at mass scale. Graham Stephan uses YouTube as a vehicle to produce finance videos at mass scale. \n\nAttempt to identify ways in which you can produce value to the market. For example, I utilised my skills in acting, storytelling, video editing, and presenting, to create videos like the one on my channel. I saw YouTube as a vehicle to be able to produce value to the market at scale. \n\n\n******\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.

    "Name": "Alan Watts - The Life Of Alan Watts",
    "Description": "Alan Watts was a British-born philosopher, writer, and speaker who is best known for his popularization of Eastern philosophy for a Western audience. He was born in London in 1915 and was educated at King\u0027s College, London, where he studied theology. He later became an Anglican minister, but left the ministry to pursue his interest in Eastern philosophy.\n\nIn the 1950s, he began giving lectures and writing books on the subject, which gained popularity in the counterculture movement of the 1960s. He wrote more than 25 books, including \u0022The Way of Zen,\u0022 \u0022The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are,\u0022 and \u0022The Tao of Philosophy.\u0022\n\nWatts was also a renowned speaker, and his lectures and talks were recorded and widely distributed.

    "Name": "Alan Watts ~ How Long Are You Going To Wear This Mask (Ego)",
    "Description": "Alan Watts, in his teachings, often discussed the concept of the ego, which he defined as the sense of self or \u0022I\u0022 that we all have. He believed that the ego is a mask that we wear, which creates the illusion of separation between ourselves and the world around us. He believed that the ego is a product of our thoughts and beliefs and that it is not the true self. He believed that many people are identified with their ego and live their lives according to its dictates, without ever questioning its validity. He argued that by identifying with the ego, people can become trapped in a limited and narrow perspective of themselves and the world, and can miss the beauty and richness of life. He believed that the ultimate goal is to let go of the ego, to see through the mask and discover the true self, which is beyond words and concepts. He urged people to question the ego, to be aware of it, and to find ways to transcend it, in order to live a more fulfilling and authentic life.\n\nSpeech extract from \nhttps://alanwatts.com/products/myth-and-religion?_pos=1\u0026_sid=ec2574fc4\u0026_ss=r\nby Alan Watts, courtesy of https://alanwatts.org.\u0022 \nFollow the Alan Watts Organization:\nYouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3wxPA1Sph--HxKGdOGVirg\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/alanwattsofficial \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alanwattsorg/\nFull lectures found at: https://www.alanwatts.com/\nSpeech licensed from: https://mindsetdrm.com/\n\n#AlanWatts  #Spirituality #Buddhism\n\n\nAlan Watts.

    "Description": "Do you feel like life is a constant game of catch-up? No matter how much you strive to get and do, you feel like you need to do more or have more? \n\nWe\u2019re encouraged to seek out success, wealth, and material possessions, against which we measure our status, self-worth and happiness. We continually strive to achieve these things, but when we get them, we feel only a fleeting sense of happiness before setting our sights on the next thing. And this pursuit of \u0027stuff\u0027 often comes at the sacrifice of our physical, mental, and emotional health.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that money is an important part of our society and having a degree of financial stability increases our ability to enjoy life. But the reality is that most of us live in a world of overabundance. We need to realise that we have enough. We need to stop linking our self-worth and happiness to doing and having more. That\u2019s a journey worth taking.\n\nTo be part of our film making journey - https://www.patreon.com/greenrenaissance \n\nWho is Green Renaissance?

    "Name": "Is Homosexuality FORBIDDEN in Hinduism?  A Scriptural Perspective.",
    "Description": "Hindu scriptures neither condemn nor condone same sex relationships and gender nonconformity -- because the ancient sages considered these to be natural parts of God\u0027s creation.\n\nAccording to the non-dual teachings of Advaita Vedanta, the true, inner self (atma) is neither male nor female. Yet, the body and mind have gender and sexuality determined by nature (prakriti). Since nature includes both male and female principles, these principles are present, in differing measures, in all beings.\n\nSwami Tadatmananda is a traditionally-trained teacher of Advaita Vedanta, meditation, and Sanskrit.

Grant is sharing what makes beautiful mind: any moment free from fear is an opportunity to taste immortality and new possibilities. \n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201CThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201D, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space.

    "Name": "Seneca - How To Manage Your Time (Stoicism)",
    "Description": "In this video we will be talking about The 10 ways to manage time from the writings of Seneca. Seneca was a Roman statesman and a stoic philosopher, who in his moral essay, On the Shortness of Life, offers us time management tips.\n\nSo here are 10 time management tips from Seneca.\n01. Treat time as a commodity\n02. Don\u2019t invest your time preparing for life\n03. Live life for your own self \n04. Practice Premeditatio Malorum\n05. Make long term rewards immediate\n06. Make the most of your free time\n07. Spend time reflecting on your past \n08. Stop wasting time in life\u2019s trivialities\n09. Invest your time creating new memories\n10. Invest your time in philosophies\n\nHope you enjoyed this video and find these insights on time management helpful. \n\nSeneca was a stoic philosopher and rhetorician. He\u2019s one of the first stoics for which there are considerable literary remains for us to study.  In his moral essay, On The Shortness Of Life, Seneca gives us an urgent reminder on the non-renewability of our most important resource: our time. \n\nStoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. Even though it is over 2000 years old, more and more people are discovering how Stoicism is not only relevant to modern times, but can be applied in very simple, yet strong ways. \n\nSubscribe To Downtown Success \u2013\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ",

    "Description": "New Pursuit of Wonder book: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D4VSD88\n\nWe are accustom to stories, jokes, ideas, riddles, etc. that have answers or conclusions. Things we can walk away with and hold on to. In Zen, however, there is a riddle that goes the other way. A riddle that self-destructs itself and denies you access to a conclusion or answer. This story-like riddle is known as a k\u014Dan, and no one can solve it.\n\nIf you are interested in supporting the channel, you can donate to our Patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/pursuitofwonder\n\nFollow Pursuit of Wonder on:\nInstagram at: https://www.instagram.com/pursuitofwonder\nFacebook at: https://www.facebook.com/PursuitOfWonder",

    "Description": "We become good at what we practice and most of us are experts at practicing distraction. We live in a society that trains us to multi-task and jump from one thing to another in an uncontrolled way. The great panacea for a world plagued by distraction is learning and practicing the art of concentration. Living as a Hindu monk for 10 years Dandapani was trained in understanding the mind. There he learned and practiced the fine art of bringing concentration into everyday life.  In this talk, Dandapani will share spiritual tools to learn to create unwavering focus in our lives and the boundless benefits that result from it.\r\n\r\nwww.tedxreno.com\n\nDandapani is a Hindu priest, speaker on self-development and an entrepreneur.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    "Description": "This video is a major departure from the usual content on my channel, but I think it\u0027s necessary. This particular moment in American and world history demands that we all take an honest look at the trajectory of the United States of America. The current system is untenable and the Coronavirus pandemic has laid bare how truly ill-prepared the country is to protect its citizens. When corporations and the ultra-wealthy are the primary concern of those in power, the majority will suffer. This video is my attempt to contribute some small amount to the national conversation about what America is, and what it needs to become. \n\nIf you\u0027d like to support this channel so I can make more content like this, please consider becoming a patron! https://www.patreon.com/secondthought \n\nFurther Reading:\n\nDebs\u2019 speech at Butte, 1902 https://www.marxists.org/archive/debs/works/1902/0616-debs-mustgainpossession.pdf \n\nMore by Debs: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6516199-writings-of-eugene-v-debs \n\nAmerican Medical Costs: https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2019/07/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries \n\nFamily Leave in America: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/16/u-s-lacks-mandated-paid-parental-leave/\n\nCollege Debt Then And Now: https://www.marketwatch.com/graphics/college-debt-now-and-then/ \n\nFed\u0027s Report on Economic Wellbeing:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2017-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201805.pdf \n\nRadical and Leftist Books: https://www.versobooks.com \n\nLeftist Politics and Culture: https://www.currentaffairs.org \n\nGood Leftist Reporting on America and Coronavirus: https://theweek.com/authors/ryan-cooper \n\n\nCapitalism And The American Pandemic Response \u2013 Second Thought\r\nSUBSCRIBE HERE: http://bit.ly/2nFsvTS\r\nWATCH LAST VIDEO HERE: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SJktA-ecJR_Fq2hhYVEFS11cf1YzG27\r\n\r\nNew video every Friday!\r\n\r\nFollow Second Thought on Social Media!\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_SecondThought\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/secondthought_irl/\r\n\r\nWatch More Second Thought:\r\nLatest Uploads: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SJktA-ecJR_Fq2hhYVEFS11cf1YzG27\r\nSpaaaaaace!: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SJktA-ecJQRpqT-hMTTFx8A6VVH3m6v\r\nWhat If...: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SJktA-ecJRI7VrWf_-mT0z6lrN--Cvi\r\nPopular Videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SJktA-ecJRx7ZaO9J04Kbob_u5baHxN\r\n\r\nAbout Second Thought:\r\nSecond Thought is a channel devoted to the things in life worth thinking about!

    "Name": "When Life is Meaningless (And Why We Feel Worthless)",
    "Description": "Why are we thrown into this world? What are we here to do? Could it be that we\u2019re here for no particular reason and that life on Earth is nothing more than a beautiful yet meaningless coincidence?\n\nIn times of religious decline, mankind is faced with the possibility that its existence is inherently meaningless. For many, this is frightening. The idea that our lives don\u2019t matter, can be difficult to accept.\n\nTo give our lives at least some significance, even if it\u2019s just on a terrestrial level, we started to create our own meaning. So, as the humans we are, we began to define what it means to live a meaningful life. What\u2019s worth living for, and what isn\u2019t? What are the requirements?\n\nWhen we have decided what a meaningful life entails, we continue grasping for it in an almost pathological manner. Because if we fail to give our lives meaning, our lives truly don\u2019t matter.\n\nAs a consequence, many people feel that their lives are worthless. They wake up, eat, engage in their daily activities, eat, go to sleep, repeat, repeat, and repeat, as opposed to those \u2018lucky few\u2019 who have found meaning in their lives, albeit because of raising children, a so-called \u2018meaningful\u2019 job, and other activities that make their existence on this desolate tiny dot surrounded by a suffocating blackness, a bit more bearable.\n\nThis video explores why we feel worthless, and the beauty and ugliness of a meaningless life (inspired by philosopher Albert Camus).\n\nSupport the channel:\n\u2714\uFE0F PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n\u2714\uFE0F Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n\u2714\uFE0F Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

    "Name": "Thich Nhat Hanh - Zen Buddhism - His Best Talk At Google (Mindfulness)",
    "Description": "Support This Channel, because Google Will Not!\nAny Amount- https://paypal.me/HelpBrandonOut\n\nVietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh (known as Thay in his circles) made a rare visit to the Googleplex to lead a half-day Health@Google workshop in the fundamentals of mindfulness. The exercises and rituals of mindfulness lay the path to optimal health and happiness.\n\nThay may be the second most famous Buddhist monk in the world, right after the Dalai Lama. He is certainly one of the best known and most respected Zen Masters in the world. Thay is a best-selling author, poet, and peace activist who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Martin Luther King Jr. He is a key pioneer in actively applying insights from meditation to solving real-world social, political and environmental problems. Thay most recently published Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life, with Harvard School of Public Health nutritionist Dr. Lilian Cheung. At 85, he\u0027s touring North America before retiring to his monastery in France.\n\nLife at Google is fast, furious and fun, yet it can take a toll on ourselves and our loved ones. Through Thay\u0027s specially crafted workshop, you\u0027ll learn how to reduce stress, eat for health, sleep better, find emotional stability, improve concentration and sustain optimal performance.\n\n--Chade-Meng Tan\n\nMonthly PayPal Donations- https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations\u0026business=MZSR2R87GMTC4\u0026lc=US\u0026currency_code=USD\u0026bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted           \n\nMy Other Social Media Links\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BulletB1983\n\nhttps://Youtube.com/Bulletbgregg \n\nYouTube App--Search: Brandon Gregg\n\nPlayStation Network: Bulletb1983\n\n#Zen #Buddhism #Philosophy",

    "Name": "Revealing the Mind: The Promise of Psychedelics",
    "Description": "Nearly every culture throughout history has used chemicals that alter consciousness for spiritual exploration. In the 20th century these drugs caught the attention of scientists. Psychedelics, as they were named, proved effective at treating intractable illnesses like depression and addiction. And they became a tool for studying the mind, opening \u201Cthe doors of perception,\u201D as Aldous Huxley wrote. But those doors slammed shut when President Nixon declared psychedelics dangerous and medically useless. Join scientists and \u201Cpsychonauts\u201D who are now picking up where research left off 50 years ago, experimenting with LSD, psilocybin, DMT and other psychedelics to heal\u2014and reveal\u2014the mind.\n\nThe Big Ideas Series is supported in part by the John Templeton Foundation.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: Alison Gopnik, Eduardo Kohn, Stephen Ross, Anil Seth\n\nMODERATOR: Emily Senay\n\nMORE INFO ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND \nPARTICIPANTS: https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/programs/revealing-the-mind-the-promise-of-psychedelics/\n\nTOPICS\n0:00 - Introduction\n6:05 - Panelist introductions\n7:27 - What are psychedelics?\n11:00 - Phenomenological effects of psychedelics\n14:31 - Brain development and plasticity\n17:15 - Psychedelic usage in the Amazon\n19:43 - Amazonian ayahuasca ceremony\n20:51 - Dissolution of the ego\n22:46 - Default mode network\n25:17 - Psilocybin testing on religious professionals\n27:59 - The shaman\u2019s message from the rain-forest\n31:04 - Rain-forest soundscape\n33:03 - Mind altering experiences without drugs\n37:03 - Philosophical questions about psychedelics\n42:37 - Can psychedelics restore brain plasticity?\n45:16 - Measuring randomness of brain activity\n51:58 - Psychedelic drugs as medicine\n58:38 - Psilocybin cancer study participants film and Q\u0026A\n1:04:43 - Treating psychiatric disorders with psychedelics\n1:09:23 - Micro-dosing and \u201Cfreelancing\u201D psychedelics\n1:13:50 - Medical complications and medication interactions\n1:18:14 - The future of psychedelics in science\n\nPROGRAM CREDITS\n- Produced by Nils Kongshaug \n- Associate Produced by Emmalina Glinskis\n- Short films produced / edited by Vin Liota\n- Music provided by APM\n- Additional images and footage provided by: Getty Images, Shutterstock, Videoblocks\n- Recorded at NYU Skirball Center\n\nThis program is part of the BIG IDEAS SERIES, made possible with support from the JOHN TEMPLETON FOUNDATION.\n\n- SUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel and \u0022ring the bell\u0022 for all the latest videos from WSF \n- VISIT our Website: http://www.worldsciencefestival.com \n- LIKE us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/worldsciencefestival\n-  FOLLOW us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/WorldSciFest",

    "Name": "Win Without Trying (A Taoist simile about losing your flow)",
    "Description": "Competitions can be nerve-wracking. The more we live up to the day on which we are supposed to shine, the more anxiety builds up. What if I perform badly? What if something goes wrong?\n\nAn Olympic swimmer trains thousands of hours, just to get that medal. A musician practices for days on end, just to perform well those few times on stage. And a student practices a speech in front of the mirror multiple times, just for that moment in front of the audience.\n\nWhen all their efforts come down to one defining moment, how can they not succumb to the pressure of the need to succeed?\n\nTaoist sage Zhuangzi (Eastern philosopher) was a keen observer of nature, including human nature. He figured out that the burden of the future often negatively affects our performances in the present moment.\n\nThis video expands on a Taoist story that\u2019s concerned with this pressure and the fear that it generates. Is it because we\u2019re trying too hard that we don\u0027t seem to enter a flow state? If so, how can we win without trying?\n\nSupport the channel:\n\u2714\uFE0F PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n\u2714\uFE0F Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n\u2714\uFE0F Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

    "Name": "Why You Need to Trust the Universe | TAOISM",
    "Description": "Trust the Universe is the first film in a series based on my Effortless Living audiobook. In this film I explore how and why we should trust the universe from a Taoist perspective. The Tao can only make use of you when you are empty of all that blocks a union between yourself and the universe. The peace that resides in the unity of trust allows the individual to harmonize with the world. This not only brings the light of Tao into the world but also guides and helps the individual along their journey through life. When we trust, the universe answers us through the resonance of our experience. The feeling of oneness brings the individual back into accord with the function of the universe.\n\nEffortless Living Audiobook https://amzn.to/31uNLQq\n\nSUBSCRIBE https://www.youtube.com/OneWorldWithin for new videos every week\n\nMY PATREON https://patreon.com/jasongregory\n\nMY BOOKS\nEffortless Living http://amzn.to/2z0EG3Q\nFasting the Mind http://amzn.to/2zhsAY1\nEnlightenment Now http://amzn.to/2B2oNuV\nThe Science and Practice of Humility http://amzn.to/2z01WPb\n\nMY CAMERA GEAR\nMain Camera https://amzn.to/2DXxuvv\nMain Lens https://amzn.to/2Shk5BF\nMicrophone https://amzn.to/2S6Evgm\nTripod https://amzn.to/2SdLxA8\n\nFOLLOW ME\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/jasongregoryauthor/\nTwitter https://twitter.com/JasonGregory33\nFacebook Personal Page https://www.facebook.com/jason.gregory.oneworldwithin\nFacebook Like Page https://www.facebook.com/JasonGregoryAuthor/\nLinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasongregoryauthor/\n\nMY WEBSITE https://jasongregory.org/",

    "Description": "Very recently, life taught me another lesson about resentment. And that letting go of resentment is actually a lot easier than the mind makes us believe. I\u2019d like to share with you what I\u2019ve learned, accompanied by a Stoic as well as Buddhist perspective. Some (useless) trivia: the place in 0:19 is the same place as in 3:21, but exactly 6 months and 5 days a part.

    "Name": "Dopamine Fasting 2.0 - Overcome Addiction \u0026 Restore Motivation",
    "Description": "This animation was made in collaboration with One Percent Better. Please subscribe! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRI6t05DNVlV0XhdI7hx_iw\nWe live in a world that is designed to stimulate our emotions. Every advertisement, food product and social media post is geared to give us a short rush of pleasure which is followed by an emptiness and a craving for more. Big companies are able to leverage our cravings and make trillions of dollars off of keeping us addicted. If you don\u2019t have a plan for yourself, you will be at the mercy of companies who will play on your impulses to control you like a puppet. You will sacrifice your free will, searching for happiness in a maze that\u2019s designed to keep you lost. Studies show that on average, people use their smartphones for about 3 hours per day [1,2]. That\u2019s 1,095 hours every year. Thankfully there is a way to regain control over your impulses and take your power back through a practice called dopamine fasting.\n\nDopamine fasting is the idea that if you avoid dopamine stimulating activities for extended periods of time, you will be able to \u2018reset your brain\u2019 and let go of addictive behaviors that negatively impact your life. It\u2019s commonly misunderstood as reducing dopamine, but that\u2019s not true. Dopamine is necessary to function as a healthy human being.\n\nDopamine Fasting exploded in interest in October 2018 and gained even more interest a year later after Dr. Cameron Sepah published an article on Medium titled \u2018The Definitive Guide to Dopamine Fasting 2.0: The Hot Silicon Valley Trend.\n\nDopamine fasting 2.0 is better defined. It\u2019s based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. It\u2019s about reducing impulsive behavior, not reducing dopamine itself. And it doesn\u2019t encourage you to act like a full-blown monk who abstains from all forms of pleasure.\n\nGet the After Skool Kid\u0027s Book - Why Don\u0027t Country Flags Use The Color Purple? - https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Country-Flags-Color-Purple/dp/0578489244\nGet in touch via https://www.afterskool.net/\nPlease support on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\n\nFollow on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/afterskool100/?hl=en\nand Facebook https://www.facebook.com/afterskool100\n\nAnimation at the end was produced by CeoQDisney https://www.instagram.com/ceoqdisney/?hl=en\n\nReferences\n1.

    "Description": "Efforts to decriminalise psilocybin, more commonly known as magic mushrooms, are gathering momentum in the United States.\n\nThe cities of Denver, Oakland and Santa Cruz have already decriminalised the psychedelic drug. Washington DC is soon expected to vote on whether to follow suit. And the state of Oregon is set to hold a poll on full legalisation. \n\nThe push is in part led by medical researchers who are finding growing evidence that the substance can effectively treat mental health conditions such as depression and PTSD.\n\nIn fact, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has fast-tracked research on psilocybin\nas a treatment for PTSD, calling it a potential breakthrough therapy.\n\nYoung tech entrepreneurs are also leading a charge towards mainstream acceptance, claiming that microdosing (taking psilocybin daily in very small amounts) can boost productivity and leadership skills.\n\nIn this episode of The Stream we ask, what evidence is there to support these claims and could magic mushrooms one day become as common in bathroom cupboards as vitamins?\n\nOn this episode of The Stream, we speak with: \nDanielle Herrera \nHarm Reduction and Psychedelic Psychotherapist \nsageinst.org\n \nIsmail Ali, @sage_izzy \nPolicy and Advocacy Counsel, @MAPS\nmaps.org\n\nMichelle Janikian, @m00shian\nJournalist\nmichellejanikian.com\n\nJoin the conversation:\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/AJStream \nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/AJStream \nSubscribe to our channel  http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\n#aljazeeraenglish\n#ajstream\n#psilocybin",

McNelly interviews Frank Herbert on February 3, 1969 at Herbert\u0027s house.\n\nSet in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which noble houses, in control of individual planets, owe allegiance to the Padishah Emperor, Dune tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose noble family accepts the stewardship of the desert planet Arrakis. As this planet is the only source of the \u0022spice\u0022 melange, the most important and valuable substance in the universe, control of Arrakis is a coveted \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 undertaking. The story explores the multi-layered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the forces of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its \u0022spice\u0022.",

According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to eudaimonia (happiness) for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by using one\u0027s mind to understand the world and to do one\u0027s part in nature\u0027s plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.\n\nThe Stoics are especially known for teaching that \u0022virtue is the only good\u0022 for human beings, and that external things\u2014such as health, wealth, and pleasure\u2014are not good or bad in themselves (adiaphora), but have value as \u0022material for virtue to act upon\u0022. Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to Western virtue ethics.[1] The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is \u0022in accordance with nature\u0022. Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual\u0027s philosophy was not what a person said, but how a person behaved.[2] To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.\n\nMany Stoics\u2014such as Seneca and Epictetus\u2014emphasized that because \u0022virtue is sufficient for happiness\u0022, a sage would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase \u0022stoic calm\u0022, though the phrase does not include the \u0022radical ethical\u0022 Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.[3]\n\nStoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism).[4]",

    "Name": "Alan Watts ~ The Power Of Releasing Control",
    "Description": "Alan Watts believed that the need for control is a fundamental aspect of the human experience, but that it can also be a source of suffering. He argued that individuals often try to control their environment and the people around them, as well as their thoughts and emotions. He suggested that individuals can overcome this tendency to control by developing a sense of self-awareness and understanding that the self is not separate from the world around it, but is instead an integral part of the interconnected web of life. He believed that by understanding the interconnectedness of all things, individuals can let go of the need to control and instead learn to flow with the natural rhythms and cycles of life. He also encouraged individuals to practice mindfulness and meditation as a way to connect with the present moment and understand the interconnectedness of all things. He also believed that by releasing control, individuals can find a sense of inner peace and contentment and be more in harmony with themselves and the world around them.\n\n\nSpeech extract from \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Do-You-Does-Universe-2005-12-01/dp/B019L52D7W/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=alan\u002Bwatts\u002Bdo\u002Byou\u002Bdo\u002Bit\u0026qid=1583418789\u0026sr=8-1\nby Alan Watts, courtesy of https://alanwatts.org.\u0022 \nFollow the Alan Watts Organization:\nYouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3wxPA1Sph--HxKGdOGVirg\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/alanwattsofficial \u2022 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/alanwattsorg/\nFull lectures found at: https://www.alanwatts.com/\nSpeech licensed from: https://mindsetdrm.com/\n\n#AlanWatts  #Spirituality #Buddhism \n\n\n\nAlan Watts.

    "Name": "How To Maximize Misery | The 4 Stoic Sins",
    "Description": "Virtue is the path to a happy life.\n\nOne can characterize Stoic virtue by its instrumental as well as non-instrumental value, meaning that Stoics don\u2019t act for personal gain, but rather to benefit the whole, even if this includes the rejection of pleasure and the endurance of pain. However, at the same time, this way of life leads to eudaimonia, and thus, living virtuously is rewarding for oneself as a byproduct.\n\nBut what if we don\u2019t live virtuously and what misery comes from that? In Stoic ethics, we find the opposite of virtue, which is vice. Vice can be subdivided into four elements. Obviously, following these elements will lead us astray.\n\nThis video explores these 4 \u2018Stoic sins\u2019 and possible consequences.\n\nSupport the channel:\n\u2714\uFE0F PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n\u2714\uFE0F Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n\u2714\uFE0F Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

    "Name": "Reasons To Stop Worrying (Break The Habit of Excessive Thinking)",
    "Description": "There\u2019s a fundamental difference between planning and worrying. Planning is constructive and focuses on our own actions in a conceptual future, while worrying is trying to control the uncontrollable by repeating possible and even unrealistic scenarios over and over again.\n\nOur worries can even consist of fantasies that are totally out of touch with reality. Therefore, as opposed to planning, it\u2019s destructive.\n\nNevertheless, we keep worrying because, for some reason, we think that this is going to help us in one way or another. Unfortunately, worrying generally does more harm than good. This video lays out reasons to stop worrying.\n\nSupport the channel:\n\u2714\uFE0F PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n\u2714\uFE0F Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n\u2714\uFE0F Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

    "Description": "Welcome To The Awakening Planet.  What you will find here is a library of meditation music that is created \u0026 handpicked by our team and specifically composed to ease the listener into a state of mind where transformation and miracles may occur. May this reiki music serve as an anchor of positivity \u0026 healing, so that you may cleanse all negativity.\n\nReiki is an ancient healing technique with roots in the Japanese culture, where the therapist channels a specific healing energy, \nwhich is projected through hands after drawing an imaginary symbol in the air. The most famous one of these symbols is the Chokurei.\n\nThe center of the practice and therapeutic effects is in the use of hands.\nWhat we mean with this is that Reiki Music itself isn\u2019t the real Reiki therapy. \nThis doesn\u2019t mean that Reiki Music doesn\u2019t work to heal body, mind and soul, but that it works by itself as specific music therapeutic resource instead.\n\n- Love, Awakening Planet.\n\n.................................... \n\n\u2605 Royalty-Free / Commercial License Music store:\nhttps://www.highermind-royaltyfreemusic.com\n\n\n\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\n\nThe eye-opening powers of healing and spiritual practices like meditation are undeniable. The proof is everywhere. Meditation can change your life and your perception of reality. You can literally harness power from within and destroy self-limiting beliefs and views that hold you back from living fully. \n\n\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\u263C\n\nYou have the ability to bend reality. You are a creator, you can manifest the reality you want to live with an abundance mindset.\n\nThis channel was created to inspire more people to get in touch with the power and love that lives within them, that lives within you. The nature and beauty that resides within need to be unchained, liberated, awakened. We do our best to inspire you to get in touch with that place within yourself.\n\nWelcome to our channel. YOU are part of the Awakening Planet\n\nIn general, we really want to inspire you and to spread some positive energy, and help our world community let go of all their baggage and suffering, and accept that love is the way. If your life is hard right now, then today is your opportunity to make a conscious positive shift and plan your master plan on how to live life in resonance and harmony with nature, love, creation.\n\nShare something you can be grateful for in the comment section,\nwe\u0027d appreciate that a lot, everyone reading will be inspired on some level. \uD83D\uDE4F\uD83D\uDC96\n\n- The Awakening Planet",

On July 5, 1852, in Rochester, New York, he gave one of his most famous speeches, \u0022The Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro.\u0022 He was addressing the Rochester Ladies\u0027 Anti-Slavery Society. This is actor James Earl Jones reading the speech during a performance of historian Howard Zinn\u0027s acclaimed book, \u0022Voices of a People\u0027s History of the United States.\u0022 He was introduced by Zinn.\n\n#DemocracyNow\r\n\r\nDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

    "Name": "Jacque Fresco - Communicational Difficulties",
    "Description": "Full lecture: https://www.thevenusproject.com/product/jacque-fresco-communicational-difficulties/\n\nIn this lecture, Fresco talks about weaknesses in communication, why they exist, and how to minimize miscommunication and confusion. He explains how everyone interprets experiences and words differently because of differences in our backgrounds.\n\nIf engineers, builders or mechanics operated with an average person\u2019s style of communication, then inventions, buildings and machines would be impossible to construct. When a surgeon asks for a scalpel, he/she does not receive a pair of scissors. In these professions, language is very precise, exact. To be able to effectively communicate, one needs to agree on common terms.\n\nRecord date: Nov. 8th, 2010\n\nFull lecture runtime: 50 minutes\n\nThe Venus Project proposes an alternative vision of what the future can be if we apply what we already know in order to achieve a sustainable new world civilization. It calls for a straightforward redesign of our culture in which the age-old inadequacies of war, poverty, hunger, debt and unnecessary human suffering are viewed not only as avoidable but as totally unacceptable. Anything less will result in a continuation of the same catalog of problems inherent in today\u0027s world. \n\nLearn more at https://www.thevenusproject.com\nSubscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.thevenusproject.com/subscribe-to-our-newsletter/\nBecome a volunteer: https://www.thevenusproject.com/become-a-volunteer/\nFind a team near you: https://www.thevenusproject.com/become-a-volunteer/venus-project-support/\nDonations: https://www.thevenusproject.com/donations/\nOfficial store: https://www.thevenusproject.com/store/\nOfficial Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/TheVenusProjectGlobal\nOfficial Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/thevenusproject/\nOfficial Pinterest page: https://www.pinterest.com/thevenusproject/\nOfficial Twitter page: https://www.twitter.com/TheVenusProject\nOfficial Hive account: https://peakd.com/@thevenusproject\nDonations: https://www.thevenusproject.com/donations/",

    "Description": "How to get the most out of a psychedelic experience - Watch before tripping!\n\nPsychedelics and plant medicine can be a powerful tool for self-awareness and exploration. However, there are a few things you should probably keep in mind before going on a psychedelic trip. \n\nBesides making sure you have the right set and setting, there are a lot of things you can do, from getting enough sleep, to prepare by doing meditation or breath work, to facilitate a beneficial experience. These are some of the things I always recommend people take into consideration. Let me know in the comments if you have any questions or if you have tips of your own. \n\nBreathwork is one of the things I recommend in the video, check out elementalacademy.org/breath for a free breathwork course.\n\nif you haven\u0027t watched my documentary Psyched Out about psychedelics and plant medicine, you can do so here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Qr94E6NpI\u0026t=287s\n\n#psychedelics #breathwork\n______________________________\nThank you for stopping by and you can check out my Podcast on your favourite channel here - \nhttps://pod.link/1087446265\n\nIf you can spare 2 minutes and leave a review on my Podcast I would greatly appreciate it! \nhttps://ratethispodcast.com/elementalawakening\n\nBe sure to stop by and chat on my Social Media Channels! \uD83D\uDE4C \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/theelementalawakening/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/elementalawakening/\n\nI will be going LIVE every Monday for some insights on what is going on and my routines!",

In March 2017, they sold their RV and bought a Sprinter Van, which they built out into a campervan to continue their travels and adventures in #vanlife style. \n\nBoth originally from the small town of Blanchard, Oklahoma, Nate and Steph enjoy learning about new cultures and experiencing different ways of life across the world. They like to meet new people from all walks of life and just sit and have a beer with whoever shows up. It\u0027s all about spontaneity in this life! \n\nThey travel with their two pups, Pyros and Sparta, who have become great travelers and adventure pups as well.\n----\nVideo filmed with all of (or some of) this equipment:\nMain Camera: http://amzn.to/2xP8mDZ\nMain Vlogging Lens: http://amzn.to/2wFELba\nCamera Stabilizer: http://amzn.to/2xOwcji\nQuick Release Plate: http://amzn.to/2fhZIGw\nOn Camera Microphone: http://amzn.to/2xQoEwg\nEditing Software: http://amzn.to/2xPi3lX\nTripod: http://amzn.to/2xOG6BE\n35mm lens: http://amzn.to/2wuDYP7\nBackup camera \u0026 Kit lenses: http://amzn.to/2wFc26f\nDrone: http://amzn.to/2wEZ7B9\nGoPro HERO 6: http://amzn.to/2y7XfF3\n----\nFollow Us Online Here:\n\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/adventure_in_a_backpack\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/adventureinabackpack\nWebsite: http://adventureinabackpack.com\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/adventure_pack_\n\n---\n\nWant to work/collaborate with us?

I highly recommend it and others of his books on this topic, including Turning Pro, Do the Work, Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit, and the Warrior Ethos. Also his books Gates of Fire about the Spartans and the battle at Thermopylae, The Lion\u0027s Gate, Tides of War, and others are some of the best historical fiction novels ever written.\n\nSubscribe to this YouTube channel or connect on:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lexfridman\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman",

    "Name": "The Accidental Anarchist | Carne Ross | TEDxSkoll",
    "Description": "A former British diplomat in the lead up to the Iraq war, Carne experienced first-hand the lies and self-serving discourse of political power. After a profound crisis, he began a quest for a more just way of living together. In this moving and deeply personal talk, Carne explains what he discovered when he studied philosophies and visited communities from varied corners of the planet, and why he thinks anarchism is the best way forward.\n\nCarne Ross is a radical writer and thinker about world affairs who leads Independent Diplomat (ID), an innovative non-profit service that helps democratic governments and political groups use diplomacy to achieve justice. Their clients include the democratic Syrian opposition and the Marshall Islands which, with ID\u0027s help, led a large coalition of countries to achieve a stronger UN climate agreement in Paris. Carne is a former senior British diplomat who resigned over the 2003 Iraq war. \r\n\r\nHaving worked on Iraq/WMD for the UK for many years at the UN, the publication of his hitherto-secret testimony about the government\u0027s lies helped create pressure for a full public inquiry into the war. Today, he writes and speaks about diplomacy and new forms of political action and democracy, in particular anarchism. He is the subject of a new feature documentary film Accidental Anarchist about his conversion from believer in government to anarchist, which will shortly be released globally.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    "Name": "A Short History of Anarchism",
    "Description": "Consider Supporting HoH: https://www.patreon.com/HouseofHistory\n\nThe year is 1881 and the Russian Tsar Alexander II has, this morning, signed the Loris-Melikov constitution, a document that provided the first timid steps towards a constitutional monarchy. Later that day, whilst riding in his carriage, members of the revolutionary anarchist movement \u201CPeople\u2019s Will\u201D attacked his carriage with bombs, severely injuring Alexander, who passed away within an hour. There had been six attempted assassinations on his life since he came into power, with this one succeeding. And\u2026 Alexander was no exception during the late 19th and early 20th century. A small part of this revolutionary anarchist movement did not shy away from violence. Until the outbreak of the First World War, anarchists were a very serious threat to the aristocracy, the monarchy, presidents and government officials. Today we\u2019ll look into some of their most notorious terror attacks during this era, which include the assassination of a French and United States president among others, and we\u2019ll look at three prominent members of the school of thought.\n\nThank you for taking the time to check out House of History, I hope you will find the films informative, interesting and enjoyable!\n\nIf you have any feedback, questions or criticism feel free to leave a comment.

Genetic mutations have been discovered in specific natural bacteria that enable them to break the polymer chains of certain plastics. Where have we found these bacteria? Well...in plastic recycling dumps of course. So, gloves and masks on everyone.

    "Description": "Hi everyone!\nOnce again I wanted to thank you all for the massive support on this project, and I\u2019m so proud of all the good that you all have created just by watching. I hope you\u2019ve found some new artists to enjoy and found a desire to always lend a helping hand where you can!\n\nRecently, I spoke with a representative at YouTube about the video fundraiser and it was found to violate Google monetization guidelines, in that it encourages \u201Cusers to click or watch ads to increase the contribution\u201D and I am working with them to amend that so that the video can return and stay up!\nHowever, because YouTube so believed in the essence of the project, they have committed to making a donation equal to what all of you have raised in the name of the project. I\u2019m still looking at which organisations will get what, and the final donation amount, but to say a phrase i\u2019ve gotten very used to saying this week, \u201CI\u2019ll let you know when I know!\u201D\n\nThe video will still be up on my channel although you\u2019ll notice there\u2019s no more ads to watch, and the title and intro may be a little different, but I still want you all to be able to enjoy the supremely talented artists involved. Please check them out on all of their listed social media, for this project wouldn\u2019t be possible without them!\n\nI\u2019d also like to thank all of the media outlets and creators using their platforms to give this project some shine. Your dedication to using your voice to share and do good work speaks volumes and I am entirely grateful. Perhaps more importantly, to all of you people who shared this video on your instagram, spoke about it with your friends and families, tweeted and watched and were excited at a way to help that you couldn\u2019t otherwise, I am BEYOND proud of you, and thank you for being part of the power behind social change. \n\nThank you so so much everyone!\nAs always, I\u2019ll keep you posted!\nLove, Zoe \uD83D\uDC97\n\nIn addition to watching this video and listening to the great artists in it, here are some petitions to sign in relation to these tragic losses and other ways to help.\n\nhttps://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co",

    "Description": "As a historic week-long uprising against police violence continues and curfews are in place across the United States, President Trump has declared himself \u0022the president of law and order\u0022 and threatened to send thousands of heavily armed soldiers into the streets. \u0022President Trump\u0027s speech almost amounted to a declaration of war against Americans,\u0022 says Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u0027 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. We also speak with William Arkin, longtime reporter on the military, who notes Trump is getting \u0022no pushback\u0022 from Defense Department officials. \n\n#DemocracyNow\r\n\r\nDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

They baffled everyone, with their inscriptions in a never before seen written language. Archaeologists, intrigued by this, started excavating these previously ignored sites.\n \nThey soon uncovered a 4,500-year-old civilisation. A civilisation completely absent in the historical record. One of the earliest urban civilizations in human history. It flourished alongside Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China around 3300-1900BCE but was bigger than all of them. A civilisation that built wonders not to gods or kings but to sanitation. A civilisation without war. Made up of massive planned cities built in brick. Masters of bronze and sculpture. They created their own writing system, traded across the vast sea, and possibly invented the world\u2019s first indoor toilets and then vanished for reasons still not understood.\n \nSo what was this civilisation in the Indus Valley, what did they achieve, and what does it have to do with rubber duckies? Well let\u2019s find out.\n\nHead to https://www.harappa.com/ to learn more!\n\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/CogitoEdu\n\nCheck Out Nebula, a streaming service made by and for educational creators.\nhttps://watchnebula.com/cogito\n\nFollow me on twitter\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CogitoEdu\n\nOr Reddit r/cogitoedu\n\nOr Facebook @CogitoYT\n\nMERCHANDISE\n\nhttps://cogitostore.teemill.com/\n\nCheck Out My Other Videos\nWhat Is Judaism | https://youtu.be/0VAylWxDQfk\nHistory Of Ancient China | Dynasties, Confucius, And The First Emperor https://youtu.be/tpy5BMhMYYw\nWho Are The San Bushmen? | https://youtu.be/1oQ5Jd7p2aY\nWhat Is Jainism? https://youtu.be/KkwmYlgkOhU\nWho Are The Berbers Of North Africa https://youtu.be/a39oM3MJleY\nWhat Is Hinduism? https://youtu.be/xlBEEuYIWwY\nWhat Is Sikhism? https://youtu.be/L-1UAORcX4c\n\n\nSources:\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Civilizations Jane R.

    "Name": "How Do We Manage Loneliness?",
    "Description": "Some people seem unable to function without daily social interaction, while others can go weeks without seeing a human being, and are perfectly fine. How do we manage loneliness?\n\nStill, we cannot ignore that many studies show us that people with lots of social connections are, in general, happier. And looking at human behavior, on the whole, we could say that, from a default position, we always tend to look for a connection with fellow humans.\n\nThus, it seems that the desire for social interaction, in one form or another, is ingrained in human nature through all stages of life. However, there\u2019s more to loneliness than an inborn need for connection (or the lack thereof). The intellectual side of loneliness is often overlooked: meaning that we hardly realize that loneliness stems, for a great part, from how we think.\n\nThis video explores different views on how to manage loneliness and proposes possible antidotes based on ancient philosophy. These philosophies are mainly geared towards acceptance and transcendence.\n\nNOTE: The \u0027antidotes\u0027 in this video are probably more suitable for people who experience loneliness from time to time, but not in ways that severely affect their mental health. If you\u0027re really in a dark place, please contact a mental health professional.\n\nHow to be happy alone? \n\nFurther learning:\n\n- Excellent video about Epictetus\u0027 \u0027forlornness\u0027 by Dr. Sadler (who was my source in this case): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMqtn3pQ1Ts\n- Buddhist lecture by Ajahn Brahm about loneliness and solitude: https://youtu.be/3e-XqXPvmFo \n\nCuts, voice, footage, script by Einzelg\u00E4nger.

    "Name": "The Philosopher Who Urinated On People | DIOGENES",
    "Description": "Diogenes strongly opposed social values and institutions, because, according to him, these are at odds with human nature.\n\nHe believed that human society infused us with all kinds of unnatural desires that are not only obsolete but also prevent us from being happy. Therefore, we should strip ourselves of these corrupting man-made constructs, so we\u2019re able to live how we\u2019re supposed to live: in agreement with nature.\n\nDiogenes\u2019 stance toward everything cultured was very obvious. He practiced what he preached, behaving obscenely, with no regard for convention. It\u2019s no surprise that people called him \u2018doggish\u2019, dog-like, or simply \u2018the dog\u2019.\n \nThis video explores Diogenes\u2019 philosophy, and what we can learn from his ideas.\n\nCuts, voice, footage, script by Einzelg\u00E4nger.

    "Name": "50 years off-grid: architect-maker paradise amid NorCal redwoods",
    "Description": "In 1968, Charles Bello and his wife, Vanna Rae, moved onto 240 acres of redwood forest looking to live a simpler life off the land. They had spent their savings to purchase the land so they got to work building their home themselves. Their first structure was a panelized A-frame that they erected in 5 days (with help from a couple family members). The total cost was $2,800.\n\nThe property is a half-hour drive down a dirt road and it was bare land when they arrived so Charles and Vanna Rae built their own infrastructure: roads, bridges and went decades without refrigeration nor phone (they eventually installed PV panels and cabling for phone lines). \n\nAfter 15 years in the A-frame, they built a cabin in the woods, and there they lived for a decade until the trees began to block out their views. In 1991 Charles (who once apprenticed under famed architect Richard Neutra) designed the Parabolic Glass House. With a curvilinear wood roof and two curved walls of windows, the home feels enveloped in trees.\n\nCharles and Vanna Rae built it for $8,500 with the timber they milled themselves, using salvaged materials for everything from doorknobs to stoves. The couple relied on photovoltaics, solar thermal and gas for power, and a dug-in greenhouse attached to the home provided much of their food. By canning and preserving, they could go for months without going to a grocery store. Their two boys were homeschooled. The couple supported themselves selling Christmas trees.\n\nNearly all the old-growth trees on the property were logged in the early 20th century, but Charles has spent the past half-century restoring the land. He and his wife set up the Redwood Forest Institute in 1997 to manage and preserve the forest. He has carefully selected 1,000 trees to be preserved for 2 millennia as the next generation of old-growth.\n\nNow, 88 years old and a widower, Charles is determined to find successors; he hopes to find \u0022three professional couples in their early 40\u0027s, financially independent, who want to settle on the property continuing 52 years stewardship of this special place in a sustainable lifestyle where one does for himself or herself rather than urban living\u0022. He is currently building \u0022glamping\u0022 guest houses that he hopes will help fund the enterprise.\n\nFrom Charles: \u0022I am still able and interested in accommodating interested parties for a tour and discussions regarding Forestry, architecture, and  sustainable lifestyle living as an alternative to urban lifestyle and other for interested parties.\u0022  \n\nContact Charles at charlesbello243@gmail.com\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/50-years-off-grid-architect-maker-paradise-amid-norcal-redwoods/",

    "Description": "How did the United States \u2014 the richest country in the world \u2014 become the worldwide epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, with one person dying of COVID-19 every 47 seconds? We spend the hour with Noam Chomsky, the world-renowned political dissident, linguist and author, discussing this unprecedented moment in history, and its political implications. Chomsky reflects on the significance of the Bernie Sanders campaign, calling it \u0022an extraordinary success\u0022 that \u0022completely shifted the arena of debate and discussion\u0022 in the United States. He also responds to President Trump\u0027s cuts to U.S. support for the World Health Organization and the surge in deaths in the United States to another record high, and discusses conditions in Gaza, the rise of authoritarianism around the world, and the progressive response.\n\n#DemocracyNow\r\n\r\nDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

    "Description": "In this video we will be talking about 10 important insights for building your Self Discipline from the writings of Marcus Aurelius. He was also a devout student of the philosophy of Stoicism. During his rule, Aurelius found the time to construct a series of autobiographical writings, now known as the Meditations. In these writings, the Marcus Aurelius offered a number of key insights on how to build self discipline.\n\nSo here are 10 important insights for self discipline from Marcus Aurelius.\n1. Self Discipline starts with finding your purpose\n2. Count on yourself\n3. Show up every day\n4. Practice voluntary hardship\n5. Practice dichotomy of control\n6. Never play the victim\n7. Practice delayed gratification\n8. Ignore naysayers\n9. Find wise people to emulate \n10.

Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. Even though it is over 2000 years old, more and more people are discovering how Stoicism is not only relevant to modern times, but can be applied in very simple, yet strong ways. \n\nDo watch our other videos on Stoicism \u2013 \n10 Stoic Teachings Of Marcus Aurelius We Desperately Need Today \u2013\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IHyzNHgEQY\n\nMarcus Aurelius \u2013 How To Be Happy (Stoicism)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8yVuT4A5Jc\n\nMarcus Aurelius \u2013 How To Be Succesful (Stoicism)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mCIfp3rc9M\u0026t\n\nSubscribe To Downtown Success \u2013\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ",

    "Name": "The Psychology of Narcissism [Traits, Symptoms, Origins \u0026 How to Protect Yourself]",
    "Description": "This video is about a specific group of individuals also known as people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder - in short: NPD - or simply referred to as \u2018narcissists\u2019. So, what\u2019s narcissism? What are the symptoms and traits? Where does it come from, and how can we identify a narcissist?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of hype around narcissism and NPD; some describe narcissists as real-life demons that are only out there to cause misery, while others put more emphasis on the fact that they\u2019re wounded souls that need healing. \n\nThis video is an exploration of the psychology of narcissism, which will hopefully lead to a better understanding. As a \u0027survivor\u0027 of narcissistic abuse, this is a personal topic. I did my best to make this video as unbiased as possible.\n\nInteresting channels for further learning:\n\nDr. Sam Vaknin: https://www.youtube.com/user/samvaknin\nDr. Ramani: https://www.youtube.com/user/DoctorRamanDurvasula\nRichard Grannon: https://www.youtube.com/user/SPARTANLIFECOACH\nNarcissistic Recovery Healing for Empaths: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu123lYBkZxaFOzDrqTdkoA\n\nCuts, voice, footage, script by Einzelg\u00E4nger.

    "Name": "FIRESTARTER - How The Prodigy Won Over the Metalheads | New British Canon",
    "Description": "From the commercial heights of nu metal to the more recent experiments with hip hop combining both emo and country, Genre fusion has come a long way. But back in the 90s Dance and Rock were separate entities. In the UK, The Stone Roses, Primal Scream, the Happy Mondays and of course New Order had been tinkering with dance music within a rock format but for the most part dance was dance, rock was rock. And rarely did anyone listen to both. Then came Liam Howlett and The Prodigy. They cared not for genre divides. Starting off as a chart-bothering rave act in 1990 with tracks like \u0022Charly\u0022 and \u0022Out of Space\u0022, by their second album, Music for the Jilted Generation, they had moved beyond pure dance into something way more interesting, for example on \u0022No Good Start the Dance\u0022, \u0022Poison\u0022 and \u0022Voodoo People\u0022. Inspiring everyone from Death Grips, Pendulum, Refused, Enter Shikari and Skrillex. Their unique mix of electronica, hip hop and rock led to their storming dance-punk crossovers 1996\u2019s \u201CFirestarter\u201D and \u0022Breathe\u0022 on the album The Fat of the Land. With them, they proved that a song could still be both danceable and metal heavy. Even today, it remains as one of the heaviest UK number one singles of all time. This is New British Canon and this is the story of How \u201CFirestarter\u201D Won Over the Metalheads.\n\n#theprodigy #RIPKeithFlint #musicdocumentary\n\nSome footage circa 1992 from Nathan Damour with VIEWstudios\n\nSoundtrack:\nLuar - Clouds (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nPatricia Taxxon - Trap (https://patriciataxxon.bandcamp.com)\nLuar - Ignite (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats) \nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\nChapters \n00:00 Introduction \n01:42 Origins \n05:37 Music For The Jilted Generation \n09:20 Firestarter\n13:03 Music Video \n15:07 Aftermath \n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",

    "Name": "Why there is no way back for religion in the West | David Voas | TEDxUniversityofEssex",
    "Description": "Religion is in decline across the Western world.  Whether measured by belonging, believing, participation in services, or how important it is felt to be, religion is losing ground.  Society is being transformed, and the momentum appears to be unstoppable. \r\n\r\nYou might be asking yourself two questions.  Is it actually true?  And even if religion is currently losing ground, could things change in the future?\n\nDavid is a quantitative social scientist with a background in demography.  He serves on the executive committee of the European Values Study and is co-director of British Religion in Numbers (www.brin.ac.uk), an online centre for British data on religion that has received recognition as a British Academy Research Project.  He serves on the editorial boards of the British Journal of Sociology and the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion.  With Mike Brewer, David directs the ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC).  He is also Deputy Director of ISER.\r\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx",

We speak with the book\u2019s author, Daniel Immerwahr, who writes, \u201CAt various times, the inhabitants of the U.S. Empire have been shot, shelled, starved, interned, dispossessed, tortured and experimented on.

Qual \u00E8 lo scopo? \n\u00C8 semplice: salvare questo paese dalla rovina in cui \u00E8 precipitato. \nCome \u00E8 potuto succedere? \nUna classe politica ignorante o collusa ha tradito l\u2019anima di questo paese: la sua Costituzione.\nPerch\u00E9 parliamo della Costituzione? \nPerch\u00E9 nella Costituzione c\u2019\u00E8 la soluzione dei nostri problemi.\n\nGli enormi problemi che oggi ci troviamo costretti ad affrontare sono solo una riedizione dei problemi dei primi del \u2018900 causati dal liberismo finanziario: la finanza si mette al di sopra di economia, politica ed etica e domina il mondo.\nLa nostra Costituzione prevede lo Stato-comunit\u00E0. Questo a sua volta prevede che la propriet\u00E0 privata e l\u2019iniziativa economica privata siano garantite nella misura in cui perseguano una funzione sociale (artt. 41 e 42 Cost.). Per questo motivo chi vive di speculazione \u00E8 in palese contrasto col dettato costituzionale.\nOggi, secondo la previsione dei padri costituenti, tutti i giudici dovrebbero vigilare sull\u2019osservanza della Costituzione, disapplicando qualunque legge in contrasto con essa.\nAl centro della Costituzione c\u2019\u00E8 la persona umana. L\u2019obiettivo fondamentale che si pone \u00E8 il pieno sviluppo della persona umana (art. 3 Cost.).\n\nPare che capire la Costituzione nella sua vera essenza non sia facilissimo, nemmeno per chi ha studiato diritto. Per capire la Costituzione bisogna infatti avere una buona conoscenza dell\u2019economia, cosa che la maggior parte dei giuristi non hanno. \nEcco perch\u00E9, dopo la morte di Aldo Moro, \u00E8 stato possibile l\u2019inizio della restaurazione neoliberista: le norme che venivano inserite nell\u2019ordinamento non erano capite dai giuristi e si sono verificate delle vere e proprie aberrazioni, una per tutte l\u2019inserimento in Costituzione del pareggio di bilancio (cd. fiscal compact).\n\nPerch\u00E9 l\u2019Italia ha un debito pubblico tanto alto? \u00C8 davvero perch\u00E9, come la propaganda mainstream ci ricorda costantemente, noi italiani abbiamo vissuto al di sopra delle nostre possibilit\u00E0? Perch\u00E9 siamo pigri, incapaci e corrotti? Ovviamente no.\nDopo il divorzio tra Ministero del Tesoro e Banca d\u2019Italia, avvenuto nell\u201981 grazie ad una lettera privata, noi abbiamo consegnato la nostra sovranit\u00E0 in mano ai mercati. Il nostro debito, da una partita interna che rappresentava la ricchezza dei nostri cittadini, \u00E8 diventato un debito odioso nei confronti delle grandi banche private. Questo debito \u00E8 composto per la maggior parte da interessi dovuti (?) a speculatori privati, interessi che sono vietati dalla nostra Costituzione.\n\nSe oggi avessimo un Governo con una forte base popolare questo potrebbe, con un semplice decreto, dichiarare l\u2019incostituzionalit\u00E0 di tutte quelle leggi che ci rendono soggetti ai mercati. Quegli stessi mercati che ci portano via i beni pubblici e le imprese.\nLe grandi famiglie rappresentanti delle \u00E9lite finanziarie lo sapevano molto bene: la sovranit\u00E0 monetaria \u00E8 fondamentale per avere il controllo sul mondo intero. Il quadro che deriva dall\u2019analisi storica di economia e finanza \u00E8 molto semplice: i pi\u00F9 forti che si portano via tutto quello che hanno i pi\u00F9 deboli. Liberoscambismo \u00E8 un altro nome del colonialismo. \nPurtroppo oggi i popoli non sono a conoscenza delle azioni scellerate che i loro governi compiono. Quando lo sapranno il terreno sar\u00E0 finalmente pronto per quella rivoluzione pacifica oggi necessaria, seguendo l\u2019esempio di Gandhi.\n\nCi aspetta un rinascimento di livello planetario. Viviamo in un periodo apocalittico in cui siamo costretti alla scelta radicale fra due strade opposte: fare un salto di coscienza e attuare cos\u00EC il progetto dei nostri padri costituenti oppure estinguerci definitivamente come umanit\u00E0.\n\nPotremmo chiedere a noi stessi: io sono in pareggio di bilancio con le emozioni? Ho la sovranit\u00E0 emozionale? Oppure le mie emozioni sono provocate da qualcuno a cui ho delegato questa sovranit\u00E0 e che di sicuro non vuole il mio bene?\nC\u2019\u00E8 la fondata speranza che tutto questo cambier\u00E0 presto: attueremo la Costituzione perch\u00E9 ora abbiamo le forze per poterlo fare. \n\nIntervento di Mauro Scardovelli in occasione della settimana estiva UniAleph \u201CGermogli di consapevolezza\u201D, Trevi 2019.\n\n\u25BAIscrizioni a Unialeph https://alephumanistica.it/universita-aleph/#iscrizioni\n\u25BAPagina Facebook di Mauro Scardovelli  https://www.facebook.com/mauroscardovellialephumanisticabiodinamica/ \n\u25BASito web dell\u2019associazione Aleph Umanistica Biodinamica di Mauro Scardovelli https://www.alephumanistica.it/\n\u25BAArchivio contenuti di Mauro Scardovelli https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UYK1a76mAkrOx-FIBg8OYOMv8c-46arH",

But as soon as she mastered the rules of philosophy, she wanted to break them. Her desire to explore the physical world to its fullest would shape her life, and eventually, inspire radical new philosophies.

    "Description": "Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized talk recommendations and more.\n\nBlack history taught in US schools is often watered-down, riddled with inaccuracies and stripped of its context and rich, full-bodied historical figures. Equipped with the real story of Rosa Parks, professor David Ikard highlights how making the realities of race more benign and digestible harms us all -- and emphasizes the power and importance of historical accuracy.\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world\u0027s leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less). Look for talks on Technology, Entertainment and Design -- plus science, business, global issues, the arts and more.

    "Name": "(2020) Framing Reality | A \u0027Plan for the Future\u0027 Documentary by David Al-Badri",
    "Description": "This is the fourth instalment of the Awakening Documentaries. All humans on the planet are living under an illusionary paradigm that can be compared to what was presented in the \u0027Matrix\u0027. A mental prison that exists within the minds of the collective. This prison exists as the societal paradigm we have chosen to accept. That is all cultural, religious, political and economic doctrines. Based on the works of the late Jacque Fresco -- who provides solutions to the human race -- this documentary is a psychological and sociological breakdown of our society. Showcasing the Multigenerational Reconstruction Project, which will be necessary to shift humanity from the path of self-destruction. Presenting alternative solutions to the world\u2019s problems. Such as new social paradigms which render the current model of living obsolete.\n\n(2:02) Part 1. The Frame of Reference\n(8:29) Part 2. Societal Engineering\n(24:09) Part 3.

The wake fades out and that tells us where the ship has been in just the same way as the past and our memory of the past tells us what we have done. But as we go back into the past, and we go back and back to pre-history and we use all kinds of instruments and scientific methods for detecting what happened, we eventually reach a point where all record of the past fades away in just the same way as the wake of a ship. Now the important thing to remember in this illustration is that the wake doesn\u2019t drive the ship any more than the tale wags the dog. Supposing there\u2019s a neurotic, difficult child\u2013one school of thought is to say, \u201CWell bang him about. Beat him up!\u201D And maybe he\u2019ll change. But then they said, \u201COh, no. That\u2019s not fair to the child to beat him up because it was his parents. They didn\u2019t bring him up properly. And so then they say, \u201CWell, punish the parents.\u201D Well the parents say, \u201CExcuse me, but our parents were neurotic too. And they brought us up badly so we couldn\u2019t help what we did.\u201D And so, since the grandparents are dead we can\u2019t get at them. And in any case, supposing we could, we would pass the whole blame back to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. And they say they started all this mess. But then Eve would say, \u201CNo! The serpent tempted me and I did eat and it was the serpent\u2019s fault!\u201D So you see, if you insist on being moved, being determined by the past, that\u2019s your game. But the fact of the matter is it all starts right now. But we like to establish our connectivity with the past because that gives other people the impression that we\u2019re sane. If you ask me, then, why am I talking? Well I could say, I\u2019m making a living this way, or I have a message that I want to get across to you. But that\u2019s not the reason. I\u2019m talking for the same reason that birds sing, and for the same reason that the stars shine, is, I dig it. Why do you dig it? Well, I could go on answering all sorts of questions about human motivation and psychology but they wouldn\u2019t explain a thing, because explaining things by the past is really a refusal to explain them at all!\n\nAlan Watts - Powerful Motivational Video\n\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\n\n\u27A4\u27A4Previous Video:\nStart By Doing It Badly | Jordan Peterson | Powerful Life Advice\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJV7HeHT4q4\n\n\u27A4\u27A4More Motivation:\nLOOK UP, MOVE AHEAD - Powerful Motivational Video | Jordan Peterson\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUmKnW1j2Xs\n\n\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\u2582\n\nFair Use Disclaimer:\n\nOur purpose is to produce quality, educational and motivational video content, and to share it with our viewers.\n\nThis video has no negative impact on the original works.\nThis video is used for educational purposes.\nThis video is transformative in nature.\nThis channel\u2019s owner claims no copyright, and cannot be held accountable.\n\nIf you are the legal content owner of any videos used here and would like them removed, please contact wordtothewise.yt@gmail.com.

It is not a \u0022psychedelic\u0022 per se but a tool to flood the conditioning in order to see, listen, speak, and act from your soul. \n\nAubrey Marcus, maker of Alpha Brain goes for Iboga Treatment and talks about it all on the Joe Rogan Experience (03-13-12). Joe Rogan and Aubrey Marcus make comparisons between DMT/Ayahuasca and Iboga and insights are recounted including the future of humanity and the nature of the universe. \n\nIboga has helped many, especially those with drug addictions, PTSD, depression, anxiety, depersonalization, and detoxing from candida, mercury and microbes. \n\n_______________________\n\nTune in each week to the JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE: http://www.joerogan.net\nRead the full journey at Aubrey Marcus\u0027 awesome blog: http://www.warriorpoet.us \u0026 experience lucid dreaming with his new product ALPHAbrain: http://www.onnit.com//alphabrain?ref=33",
