SPRINT

- [X] Make the YouTube interface a single page deal instead of adding all those submenus:
	- [X] The page would focus on importing videos from Youtube 
	- [ ] Sources:		
		- [ ] The youtube playlists of user 
			- [ ] I need the user's channel id from somewhere (maybe settings?)
			- [ ] IMPORTANT: what happens if we continue reimporting the same playlist
			over and over? We need to be sure we don't duplicate playlist and videos.
				- [ ] At the very least it should warn the user that the playlist already exists
				and ask if they want to continue by simply adding the new videos to the existing
				playlist
				- [ ] If the user accepts we would only import videos that are not already in videomatic.
					- [ ] If the video is already in videomatic we would simply now link it to this 
					playlist (if it isn't already)
					- [ ] If the video is not alreayd in videomatic we would import it and then link it 
					to this playlist			
		- [X] A simple Youtube video URL 
			- [X] this can be either typed in a text box or dragged and dropped
		- [X] A YouTube playlist URL
			- [ ] it would be nice if dragging and dropping would detect this
			- [X] ultimately this would queue the import of videos and associate a playlist
			tag to them for when the import is done. 
		- [ ] The youtube history of user (future)
			- [ ] this might be an issue unless I OAUTH2 this crap

		- [X] Provide a button to start queueing video imports
			- [X] This will queue the import of videos from the sources above
			
		- [ ] This page should also display what is still being imported server side.
			- [ ] When videos are imported the user shluld get a notification in the UI
			which allows him to go to the video or playlist which was just imported
			- [ ] Possibly send an email?

******************
Non UI
******************

- [ ] Integrate Identity platform
	- [ ] The database will need to be updated.
		- [X] Maybe I switch long to int in the primary keys?

		- [ ] Future: it's probably wise to make playlists work like a tree so we will
			  need to add a ParentId property or something at some point
		- Verify we log the IP of the users and all that type of stuff.

- [ ] Speed up the crap to get the transcripts at some point
	- [ ] Wait for queuing to be done before doing this

- [ ] Add whatever fields we need to make the DB multi tenant.
	- [ ] Add Owner fields to all entities so we know who made what
	- [ ] R&D on how to do this:
		- [ ] There's something in the EF Core docs about this
	- More to add:
		-CreatedOn/UpdatedOn/LastAccessedOn
		-Vote (1 to 10 number)
		-IsStarred (already done)	
	
- [ ] Ensure I can login at least with Google
	- [ ] See if I can grab the YT user id and channelid from the claims!!

- [ ] Add authorization!!
	- [ ] At the beginning it will probably be all allowed with the 
	exception of the developer/tester pages so there's really 
	a few roles to think about: ADMIN/USER/TESTER.

- [ ] Finish the Semantic Kernel integration or make some basic stuff work.
	- [ ] Consider using the database or configuration to store the Prompts		
	
- [ ] Add caching
	- [ ] I will start with in memory cache:
		- [ ] Add Redis at a later time (after MVP).

- [ ] Find out how to store secrets in Azure.
	- [ ] CONSIDERATION: I don't need to have a full CI/CD pipeline working.
	If I can do a simple manual deploy of sorts (from VS) it should be fine for
	the time being.

- [ ] Documentation in code

- [ ] Documentation on github

- [ ] Add support for cancellation tokens in unit tests: the SLOWxxx tests don't 
stop if I click the Stop button in VS.

DONE

- [X] Ability to queue jobes;
	- [X] USE HANGFIRE? Do a little R&D on it
	- [X] Video imports from YouTube (no tune ups for Transcript at this point)		
	- [X] Play list imports from YouTube

- [X] Remove my custom code for accessing the YT API and swap to the Google nuget package

	- [X] Add logging to files
	- [X] Add logging to the console
	- [X] Add logging to Seq
	- [ ] R&D on application insights
		- [ ] Add logging to application insights

- [X] Add the ability to Star Videos by adding an extra property
	- [X] Requires rescaffolding the database
- [X] Add the ability to Star Playlists by adding an extra property
	- [X] Requires rescaffolding the database

- [X] This is probably the best time to change the id from long to int!	

******************
User interface
******************



- [ ] Add pages to edit:
	- [ ] Playlist		
	- [ ] Video
		- [ ] Main (card again?)
		- [ ] Artifacts
		- [ ] Transcripts		
		- [ ] Some control to add Tags

- [ ] Make the cards nicer:
	- [ ] Playlist
	- [ ] Video

- [ ] Remove Videos submenu and do the following:
	- [ ] Add the following under Playlist
		- [X] Create a 'All Videos' fake playlist (gray/system) which will
		display all the videos
		- [X] Create a 'Starred' fake playlist (gray/system) which will
		display all the videos that have been starred
			- [ ] Will need a change to VideoDTO and related query
		- [ ] Create a 'History' fake playlist (gray/system) which will
		display all the videos in order of last imported 
			- [ ] In the future we can add a 'Last Viewed' property too or 
			something like that
	- [ ] [PLUS] This should address the issue with the menu items!

- [ ] Divide the Videos page:
	- [ ] SearchBar should be reusable (component)
		INPUT: TTYPE (Type)

		- [ ] Search textbox and search Button with Voice detection

		- [ ] Fulltext search options (component)
			INPUT: TTYPE (Type)

			- [ ] the type of FullTextSearch to perform (FreeText or Contains)
			- [ ] A checkbox list dropdown of fields to search in our full text for a given TDTO
		
		- [ ] Sorting options<TDTO> (component)
			INPUT: TTYPE (Type)

			- [ ] A drop down for sorting
			- [ ] A drop down for sorting order (ascending or descending)						

		- [ ] A numeric box or drop down to select how many records per page to show
		
		- [ ] Event callback or whatever for OnSearch, so it can notify the parent component
		of all the options above

	- [ ] Results page?
		INPUT: TTYPE (Type)
			   TCARDTYPE
		- [ ] Contains the base datagrid or datalist with all default property configurations
			- [ ] Maybe make properties for thins like max- [ ] width, max- [ ] height, etc
		- [ ] Exposes a data property for the binding
		- [ ] 

		- [ ] Displays what is fetched after the OnSearch callback is invoked from the SearchBar
		and excuted by the Videos page which contains such searchbar.
		- [ ] Ideally it should display either either:
			- [ ] Cards
			- [ ] Infinite scroll
			- [ ] Maybe grid?
		- [ ] Displays the pagination component

		- [ ] Add a way to star a video

- [ ] Playlists page should follow suit:
	- [ ] Use the SearchBar component
	- [ ] Use the Results component


- [ ] Add functionality for user button at the top of the screen
	- [ ] Should show a sub menu with these options (similar to Chrome):
		- [ ] Manage your Profile
		- [ ] Settings
		- [ ] Logout

- [ ] Add "Manage your Profile" page
	- [ ] Hopefully the Identity screens will suffice?

- [ ] Add "Settings" page
	- [ ] Should show at least
		- [ ] Change password
		- [ ] Change email
		- [ ] Change profile picture
		- [ ] Change theme (later)
		[Definitely needs more]

- [ ] Add "Logout" functionality 

- [ ] Implement Dashboard page
	- [ ] Should show at least 
		- [ ] The number of playlists
		- [ ] The number of videos
		- [ ] The number of artifacts
		- [ ] The number of lines for transcriptions
		- [ ] The number of tags
		[Definitely needs more]

- [ ] It would be nice to integrate a calendar (https://blazor.radzen.com/scheduler) so we
can see which movies we've seen in what day?

- [ ] Add Gravatar support for the profile picture (https://blazor.radzen.com/gravatar)
	- [ ] Use ProfileMenu component to display the picture (https://blazor.radzen.com/profile-menu)


DONE

- [X] Finish resolving the issue with the Videos menu conflicting with those under 
 Playlists. It's basically highlighting by action uri
