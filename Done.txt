- [X] Make sure we don't reimport objects repeatedly
		- [X] Playlist duplication

- [X] Major cleanup of domain, EF Core schema and other things of this nature. This
      follows the 'remove complexity' task.

	- [X] Wait for queuing to be done before doing this

	- [X] Make sure we return Result<> from all methods that should!
		- Like IVideoHostingProvider

- [X] Add support for cancellation tokens in unit tests: the SLOWxxx tests don't 
stop if I click the Stop button in VS.

- [X] Ability to queue jobes;
	- [X] USE HANGFIRE? Do a little R&D on it
	- [X] Video imports from YouTube (no tune ups for Transcript at this point)		
	- [X] Play list imports from YouTube

- [X] Remove my custom code for accessing the YT API and swap to the Google nuget package

- [X] Add logging
	- [X] Add logging to files
	- [X] Add logging to the console
	- [X] Add logging to Seq
	- [ ] R&D on application insights
		- [ ] Add logging to application insights

- [X] Add the ability to Star Videos by adding an extra property
	- [X] Requires rescaffolding the database
- [X] Add the ability to Star Playlists by adding an extra property
	- [X] Requires rescaffolding the database

- [X] This is probably the best time to change the id from long to int!	

******************
User interface
******************

DONE

- [X] Make the YouTube interface a single page deal instead of adding all those submenus:
	- [X] The page would focus on importing videos from Youtube 
	- Sources:		
		- [skipper] The youtube playlists of user 
			- [skipped] I need the user's channel id from somewhere (maybe settings?)
			- [moved] IMPORTANT: what happens if we continue reimporting the same playlist
			over and over? We need to be sure we don't duplicate playlist and videos.
				- [moved] At the very least it should warn the user that the playlist already exists
				and ask if they want to continue by simply adding the new videos to the existing
				playlist
				- [moved] If the user accepts we would only import videos that are not already in videomatic.
					- [moved] If the video is already in videomatic we would simply now link it to this 
					playlist (if it isn't already)
					- [X] If the video is not alreayd in videomatic we would import it and then link it 
					to this playlist			
		- [X] A simple Youtube video URL 
			- [X] this can be either typed in a text box or dragged and dropped
		- [X] A YouTube playlist URL
			- [skipped] it would be nice if dragging and dropping would detect this
			- [X] ultimately this would queue the import of videos and associate a playlist
			tag to them for when the import is done. 
		- [skipped] The youtube history of user (future)
			- [skipped] this might be an issue unless I OAUTH2 this crap

		- [X] Provide a button to start queueing video imports
			- [X] This will queue the import of videos from the sources above
			
		- [X] This page should also display what is still being imported server side. (we have the /hangfire endpoint)
			- [skipped] When videos are imported the user shluld get a notification in the UI
			which allows him to go to the video or playlist which was just imported
			- [skipped] Possibly send an email?

- [X] Finish resolving the issue with the Videos menu conflicting with those under 
 Playlists. It's basically highlighting by action uri
